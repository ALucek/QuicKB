      "The Roman god Janus famously has two faces.  One looks backward, toward the past; the \nother looks forward, toward the future.  Mythologists understand his two-faced depiction as complementary, not contradictory.1  It means that every beginning has an ending, every ending a \nbeginning.  Like a doorway, Janus looks both ways.",
      "So, too, with our Nation\u2019s open government laws.  In general, the Freedom of \nInformation Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) is backward looking, requiring agencies to disclose historical documents kept by the agency upon request from a private party.  Under the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (\u201cFACA\u201d), certain federal advisory bodies are subject to forward-looking publication requirements, such as giving notice of their meetings, opening them to the public, \nand proactively making their records publicly available.  But can the same body be subject to \nboth laws?",

      "The Court previously held that the National Security Commission on Artificial \nIntelligence is an agency subject to FOIA.  EPIC v. Nat\u2019l Sec. Comm\u2019n on Artificial Intelligence (\u201cNSCAI\u201d), 419 F. Supp. 3d 82, 83 (D.D.C. 2019).   Given that holding, the Commission now argues that it cannot possibly also be subject to FACA\u2019s forward-looking disclosure obligations.  \nToday, the Court holds that, like Janus, the Commission does indeed have two faces, and that Congress obligated it to comply with FACA as well as FOIA.   \nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center (\u201cEPIC\u201d) sued to enforce the Commission\u2019s obligations under both FOIA and FACA.  The Court denied the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss \nthe FOIA claims.  Id.  The Government now moves to dismiss EPIC\u2019s FACA claims and its related claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d).  EPIC moves for summary \njudgment on these counts.  While the Court will dismiss the APA claims for lack of jurisdiction, it will grant summary judgment for EPIC on its FACA claims.        \nI. \n \nThe Court\u2019s previous opinion provides background on the Commission and EPIC\u2019s suit.

But before resolving that, the Court must address some threshold issues. \n6 To start, the Court will dismiss EPIC\u2019s APA claims for lack of jurisdiction.  \u201cAbsent a \nwaiver of sovereign immunity, the Federal Government is immune from suit.\u201d  Loeffler v. Frank, 486 U.S. 549, 554 (1988).  The APA waives sovereign immunity when a party seeks relief against an \u201cagency,\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(1).  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702; Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 187 & n.13 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  If an entity is not an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1), the waiver does not apply and the Court lacks jurisdiction over any APA claims against that entity. Trudeau, 456 F.3d at 187 & n.13; see FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (\u201cSovereign",
      "immunity is jurisdictional in nature.\u201d).  So the Court must first determine whether the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1).  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 98 (1998) (affirming \u201cthe necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the \nmerits\u201d). \n \nBoth parties assume the Court\u2019s previous opinion answered this question in the affirmative.  See Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Mem.\u201d) at 14, 16 n.2, ECF No. 28-1; Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mem.\u201d) at 28, ECF No. 31-1.  But they are mistaken.  The opinion did not hold that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under",
      "\u00a7 701(b)(1).  It held only that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1).  The APA and FOIA define \u201cagency\u201d differently.  The APA defines an agency as \u201ceach authority of the Government.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551(1), 701(b)(1).  FOIA incorporates this definition but also expands it:  \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 as defined in [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1)] includes any \nexecutive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the \nExecutive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 552(f)(1). \n7 The chronology behind these definitions is key.  Before 1974, \u201ceach authority of the Government\u201d was the sole definition of \u201cagency\u201d for both the APA and FOIA.  See id. \u00a7 551(1) (stating that the APA\u2019s definition of \u201cagency\u201d applies \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subchapter,\u201d",
      "which includes FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552); Energy Research Found. v. Def. Nuclear Facilities Safety Bd., 917 F.2d 581, 583 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  During this period, the D.C. Circuit interpreted the phrase \u201ceach authority of the Government\u201d in \u00a7 551(1) to mean \u201cany administrative unit with \nsubstantial independent authority in the exercise of specific functions.\u201d  Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1971).3  So for a few years, Soucie supplied the sole test for \u201cagency\u201d",
      "status under FOIA.  See Energy Research, 917 F.2d at 584. \nThe landscape changed in 1974, when Congress amended FOIA and expanded its definition of \u201cagency.\u201d  Pub. L. No. 93-502, \u00a7 3, 88 Stat. 1561, 1564 (1974); Energy Research, 917 F.2d at 583.  The 1974 amendment is currently codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1). The definition of \u201cagency\u201d in \u00a7 552(f)(1) applies only \u201c[f]or purposes of this section,\u201d so it is exclusive to FOIA.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1).  Indeed, with the language in \u00a7 552(f)(1), \u201cCongress sought to encompass entities that might have eluded the APA\u2019s definition in \u00a7 551(1).\u201d  Energy Research, 917 F.2d at 583.  The upshot is that if an entity fits one of the categories in \u00a7 552(f)(1)\u2014such as \u201cestablishment in the executive branch\u201d\u2014it will not",
      "3  Though Soucie cited only \u00a7 551(1), see 448 F.2d at 1073 n.13, its interpretation applies equally to the identical phrase in \u00a7 701(b)(1).  See Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d 607, 616 & n.54 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (citing Soucie, among other authorities, in concluding that the Micronesian Claims Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1)); Flaherty v. Ross, 373 F. Supp. 3d 97, 104 & n.2 (D.D.C. 2019); see also Pl.\u2019s Reply at 6 & n.1, ECF No. 35.  This accords with the canon that a phrase\u2014here, \u201cauthority of the Government\u201d\u2014\u201cis presumed to bear the same meaning \nthroughout a text.\u201d  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of",
      "Legal Texts 170 (2012).  Thus, under Soucie, the touchstone of \u201cagency\u201d status under \u00a7 701(b)(1) \nis the exercise of \u201csubstantial independent authority.\u201d 8 \nnecessarily qualify as an \u201cauthority of the Government\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) and \u00a7 701(b)(1).  See id. at 583\u201384.  Congress thus allowed for something to be an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) or \u00a7 701(b)(1).  In other words, because of the 1974 amendment, all \nAPA agencies are FOIA agencies, but not vice-versa. The Commission is precisely this sort of FOIA-only agency.  The Court\u2019s previous \nopinion got us halfway to this conclusion, since it held that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1).  Any impression conveyed that the Commission is also an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) \nand \u00a7 701(b)(1) was dicta. Energy Research was the template for the Court\u2019s opinion.  It held that the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board was an \u201cagency\u201d under FOIA because the Board\u2019s organic statute called it an \u201cestablishment in the executive branch,\u201d one of the categories in \u00a7 552(f)(1).",
      "Id. at 582\u201383.  And there was \u201cnothing to indicate that Congress intended to excuse the Board from complying with FOIA.\u201d  Id. at 583.  That was the end of the matter.  For entities that fit into one of the \u00a7 552(f)(1) categories, Soucie\u2019s functional test determines agency status only if the entity is in the White House.  See id. at 584 (citing Crooker v. Office of the Pardon Attorney, 614 F.2d 825, 828 (2d Cir. 1980)).  The Board was not in the White House, so the functional test was irrelevant to its status as an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1).  See id. at 582\u201384.  Then in dicta, the",
      "court opined that the Board exercised \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d and thus was also a \nFOIA \u201cagency\u201d under Soucie\u2019s functional test.  Id. at 584\u201385. This Court\u2019s previous opinion followed Energy Research\u2019s analytical steps.  As with the \nBoard, Congress made the Commission an \u201cestablishment in the executive branch,\u201d one of the categories in \u00a7 552(f)(1).  NSCAI, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 86.  Also like the Board, nothing in the Commission\u2019s organic statute suggested that Congress intended to excuse it from FOIA.  Indeed, \n9 \nthe opposite was true, since the 2019 NDAA excused a different entity from FOIA but did exempt the Commission.  Id. at 86\u201387.  And Soucie did not apply because\u2014again like the Board\u2014the Commission is not in the White House.  Id. at 89.  \u201cThe text of \u00a7 552(f)(1)\u201d was therefore \u201cdispositive\u201d of the Commission\u2019s status as a FOIA \u201cagency.\u201d  Id. \nThen, relying on the dicta from Energy Research, the Court suggested in passing that the Commission exercises \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d and thus could meet Soucie\u2019s \nfunctional test, too.  Id. at 89\u201390.  Still, the Court made clear that this functional test was \u201cnot",
      "relevant.\u201d  Id. at 90.  So, just as in Energy Research, its application of the functional test was \ndicta.  And because this discussion relied on the dicta from Energy Research, this was dicta upon dicta. \n \n The Government is thus imprecise when it asserts as the \u201claw of the case\u201d that the Commission is an \u201cagency.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 16 n.2.  This assertion\u2014without reference to \nspecific statutory provisions\u2014is only half correct.  Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201cthe same issue presented a second time in the same case should lead to the same result.\u201d  LaShawn A. v. Berry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Dicta is not part of the law of the case.  Nat\u2019l Souvenir Ctr., Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., 728 F.2d 503, 511 (D.C. Cir. 1984). By these standards, the law of this case is that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \n\u00a7 552(f)(1), because that was the dispositive point in the Court\u2019s first opinion.  But any dicta\u2014 including that the Commission also met Soucie\u2019s functional test\u2014is not the law of this case. \nUnlike last time, it is now necessary to decide whether the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d",
      "under \u00a7 701(b)(1)\u2014as noted, the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over EPIC\u2019s APA claims turns on this.  The Government implicitly concedes that the Commission is an agency under \u00a7 701(b)(1), since it mistakenly reads the Court\u2019s previous opinion as having held this.  See Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 14, 16 \n10 n.2.  But the Court cannot simply adopt this concession.  \u201c[S]ubject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court\u2019s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.\u201d  United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002).  The Court thus has \u201can independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists.\u201d  Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006). \nAnd upon closer examination, the Court finds that the Commission is not an agency",
      "under \u00a7 551(1) or \u00a7 701(b)(1).  The D.C. Circuit\u2019s cases highlight two factors that are central to \nwhether an entity wields \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d:  investigative power and authority to make final and binding decisions. \nConsider first Soucie.  The Circuit held that the Office of Science and Technology \n(\u201cOST\u201d) was an agency because, beyond advising the President, it had the \u201cindependent function of evaluating federal programs.\u201d  448 F.2d at 1075.  Critically, in carrying out this \u201cindependent function,\u201d the OST wielded \u201cportions\u201d of Congress\u2019s own \u201cinvestigatory power.\u201d  Id. at 1075 & n.27.  In describing this power, the court cited McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135 (1927), which upheld the Senate\u2019s authority to compel testimony.  Id. at 180. \nThe next decision introduced another factor:  whether an entity has \u201cformal decision- making power.\u201d  Grumman Aircraft Eng\u2019g Corp. v. Reneg. Bd., 482 F.2d 710, 715 (D.C. Cir. 1973), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 421 U.S. 168 (1975).  In holding that \u201cRegional Boards\u201d were",

Not quite.  Congress formed the Commission using language that tracks FACA\u2019s definition \nof \u201cadvisory committee.\u201d  That was enough to \u201cmake\u201d the Commission an advisory committee. It is a fair point that Congress did not declare in so many words that \u201cFACA shall apply\u201d \nto the Commission.  But a weak one.  The one example the Government cites was in the Pandemic Act, not the 2019 NDAA.  The 2019 NDAA itself contains no examples of Congress saying that \u201cFACA shall apply.\u201d  It contains only examples of Congress saying that \u201cFACA shall \nnot apply.\u201d  Yet the NDAA does not use this language for the Commission.  This reinforces the",
      "conclusion that Congress made the Commission an \u201cadvisory committee.\u201d  See Russello, 464 \nU.S. at 22\u201323. \n18 EPIC also points out that Congress passed on a second chance to exempt the Commission \nfrom FACA.  Pl.\u2019s Mem. at 19\u201320.  The 2020 NDAA extended the life of the Commission and gave it some new reporting deadlines, but it said nothing about FACA.  See Pub. L. No. 116-92, \u00a7 1735.  And once again, Congress exempted a different entity from FACA in the same law.  See id. \u00a7 6433(a) (\u201cThe Federal Advisory Committee Act . . . shall not apply to the [advisory board \nfor the National Reconnaissance Office].\u201d). The Government responds that \u201cthere was no need to include a FACA exemption\u201d in the \n2020 NDAA because (1) Congress passed it after this Court ruled that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d; (2) Congress is presumed to know extant law; and (3) extant law holds that an \u201cagency\u201d cannot also be an \u201cadvisory committee.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Reply at 18.  But even assuming \nCongress would note an interim ruling by a district court in ongoing litigation, this third premise",
      "is wrong\u2014under extant law, at least some agencies can be advisory committees, and the \nCommission is case in point.  See infra Section III.B.1. In short, the language that Congress used to create the Commission matches FACA\u2019s \ndefinition of \u201cadvisory committee.\u201d  And Congress twice declined to excuse the Commission from FACA, even though both laws carved out FACA exemptions for other entities.  The Court \nthus concludes that the Commission is an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d subject to FACA. The Government resists this conclusion on two overarching grounds. \n1. \n \nIts primary contention is that the Commission, as an \u201cagency,\u201d cannot also be an \u201cadvisory committee.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 8.  This argument fails because the Government\u2019s \nauthorities do not support the categorical principle that all agencies cannot be advisory committees.  At most they suggest that a \u00a7 551(1) agency cannot be an advisory committee.  \n19 That is significant, because the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1).  See supra Section III.A.  The Government cites no case holding that \nthis sort of agency cannot be an advisory committee.  To the contrary, Congress has devised a",
      "statutory scheme that allows \u00a7 552(f)(1) agencies like the Commission to be advisory \ncommittees subject to FACA. \n \nThe Government\u2019s notion of a categorical principle stems mainly from a series of decisions in this District.  Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 14; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 9 n.2.  The first was Gates v. Schlesinger, 366 F. Supp. 797 (D.D.C. 1973), which stated that \u201can advisory committee is not an \n\u2018agency.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 799. Gates\u2019s first rationale for this conclusion was that FACA \u201cutilizes the definition of \nagency contained in . . . 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1)\u201d and \u201ccontains a separate and distinct definition of an \u2018advisory committee.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 798\u201399.  It is true that FACA defines \u201cadvisory committee\u201d in \u00a7 3(2) and separately defines \u201cagency\u201d in \u00a7 3(3).  5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 3(2), (3).  But nothing in section 3 excludes the possibility that an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d can fit within the definition of \n\u201cagency\u201d and vice-versa.  And certainly, agencies are commonly \u201cestablished by statute,\u201d \u201cutilized by the President,\u201d or even \u201cutilized\u201d by other agencies \u201cin the interest of obtaining \nadvice or recommendations.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 3(2) (definition of \u201cadvisory committee\u201d).",

      "In any event, Gates is distinguishable because it says nothing about entities\u2014like the \nCommission\u2014that are agencies under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1).  And it could not have. Gates was decided in 1973, before Congress added \u00a7 552(f)(1) in 1974.  FACA defines \u201cagency\u201d to have \u201cthe same meaning as in section 551(1) of title 5.\u201d  5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 3(3).  And FACA does not mention \u00a7 552(f)(1).  So even if Gates is right that FACA\u2019s definitions of \u201cadvisory committee\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d are mutually exclusive, this just means an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) cannot be an advisory committee.  Nothing in FACA or Gates prevents a \u00a7 552(f)(1) agency \nfrom also being an advisory committee. This point\u2014that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1)\u2014is key for another reason.  Under Soucie, the touchstone of agency status under \u00a7 551(1) is \n\u201csubstantial independent authority.\u201d  Gates, Washington Research Project, and the DOJ\u2019s Office",
      "of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d) suggest that entities wielding \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d \ncannot be \u201cadvisory\u201d committees.  But even if true, this point is irrelevant here, since the Commission does not wield \u201csubstantial independent authority.\u201d  See supra Section III.A. \nSpecifically, Gates cites Soucie\u2019s holding that \u00a7 551(1) \u201cconfers agency status on any administrative unit with substantial independent authority.\u201d  366 F.

This reasoning suggests that the concept of \u201cadvisory\u201d in FACA and the concept of \u201csubstantial \nindependent authority\u201d in \u00a7 551(1) are mutually exclusive. The D.C. Circuit echoed this suggestion when, applying Soucie\u2019s \u201csubstantial \nindependent authority\u201d test, it opined that \u201cIRGs are advisory committees . . . and are not agencies [under \u00a7 551(1)].\u201d  Wash. Research Project, 504 F.2d at 246\u201347.  This decision, like \n21 Gates, came before Congress enacted \u00a7 552(f)(1), so it could not have been drawing any \nconclusions about entities that are agencies under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1).7",
      "To be sure, the OLC has opined that entities wielding substantial independent authority\u2014\ni.e., \u00a7 551(1) agencies\u2014cannot be advisory committees.  \u201cFACA,\u201d in its view, \u201cis predicated on the assumption . . . that advisory committees give advice and recommendations, whereas \nagencies are operating arms of government characterized by \u2018substantial independent authority in the exercise of specific functions.\u2019\u201d  Disclosure of Advisory Comm.

It is not entirely clear that \u201cadvisory\u201d and \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d are \nmutually exclusive concepts.  But the Court need not resolve this, because the Commission does not wield \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d and is not an agency under \u00a7 551(1).  See supra Section III.A.  The exclusive focus on \u00a7 551(1) in Gates, Washington Research Project, and the \nOLC opinion does not speak to whether an entity like the Commission\u2014an \u201cagency\u201d only under \u00a7 552(f)(1)\u2014can be an advisory committee. \nAfter Gates, the next decision to conclude that \u201can advisory committee cannot have a",

So it provides no more support for the Government\u2019s position than Washington \nResearch Project itself. \n22 It gave another rationale:  \u201cthe definition of \u2018advisory committee\u2019 in [FACA] specifically \nexcludes \u2018any committee which is composed wholly of fulltime officers or employees of the Federal Government,\u2019 thus providing further evidence that \u2018agency\u2019 and \u2018advisory committee\u2019 were not meant by Congress to be congruent concepts.\u201d  Id.

The implicit assumption in this rationale is that all agencies are \u201ccomposed wholly of \nfulltime officers or employees of the Federal Government.\u201d  But Wolfe gave no basis for that assumption, nor does the Government provide any.  See Defs.\u2019 Reply at 12\u201313.  The better approach is simply to ask if an entity consists wholly of full-time federal employees.  If so, it is \nnot an advisory committee, no matter if it is an agency. More, Wolfe is also outdated.

FOIA, by contrast, \u201ccontains no equivalent exception.\u201d Id.  Assuming without deciding that this \u201cstaff work\u201d exception exists,9 the Court sees no \nconflict.  Under the Government\u2019s framing of the exception, if FACA and FOIA apply to the",
      "same entity, FACA requires it to disclose certain records, and FOIA requires it to disclose certain \nadditional records.  But this would just mean an entity that is both an advisory committee and an agency has greater transparency obligations\u2014for \u201cstaff work\u201d\u2014than an entity that is only an \nadvisory committee.  There is nothing problematic about this.

Those cases dealt with advisory committees already subject to \nFACA, and the question was whether they were also agencies.  If the answer were yes, both decisions reasoned, that would allow the advisory committee to exploit Exemption 5, which would undermine FACA\u2019s purpose.  See Gates, 366 F.

The Government now tries to argue that \nbecause Exemption 5 may shield some records that FACA would otherwise bring to the light of day\u2014which would work to the Government\u2019s advantage\u2014the Court should excuse the \nCommission from FACA entirely.  But permitting the Government this double advantage would \nhardly serve FACA\u2019s goal of transparency. More, Exemption 5 fails to present a conflict.

Assuming for sake of argument that this framing is correct, it \nrepresents a way to reconcile FOIA and FACA:  working together, they favor withholding certain documents.  Cf. Pl.\u2019s Reply at 8 (\u201cThe fact that the FOIA and the FACA generally treat deliberative records differently does not make the statutes irreconcilable; it simply means that a \ncourt must reconcile [their] disclosure provisions if and when that court confronts an assertion of Exemption 5 by a dual FOIA-FACA entity.\u201d (citation omitted)). \n27 \nThe lack of a conflict is particularly apparent here because FACA\u2019s disclosure provision",

See FDIC v. Phila Gear Corp., 476 U.S. 426, 431\u201332 (1986).  In that case, definitions in the regulations carried special weight because the FDIC had \u201cdeveloped and interpreted\u201d them \u201cfor \nmany years within the framework of the complex statutory scheme that [it] administers.\u201d  Id. at \n431.",
      "Here, by contrast, the Government presents no reason why the provision it cites, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.403, is even a \u201crelevant federal regulation\u201d for the term \u201cpermanent\u201d in FACA.

More, the definitions in this regulation apply only \u201c[i]n this subpart,\u201d i.e., the subpart of the civil service regulations implementing a set of \u201cpay-grade\u201d statutes far afield of FACA.  5 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 531.403; see id. \u00a7 531.401. \n31",
      "In any event, the regulation\u2019s definition of \u201cpermanent\u201d does not help the Government.  \nThe specific term that \u00a7 531.403 uses is not \u201cpermanent employee\u201d but \u201cpermanent position.\u201d Its definition is \u201ca position filled by an employee whose appointment is not designated as \ntemporary by law and does not have a definite time limitation of one year or less.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 531.403.  Under this definition, the Commission\u2019s members do not occupy \u201cpermanent \npositions\u201d because their appointment is \u201cdesignated as temporary by law\u201d in the 2019 NDAA. Again, the Government offers no persuasive reason\u2014or indeed, any reason at all\u2014why \nemployees of a \u201ctemporary\u201d federal organization would be anything but \u201ctemporary\u201d federal employees.  See Defs.\u2019 Reply at 15 n.5. \nThe Government also tries to rely on a \u201ccommon law\u201d meaning of \u201cpermanent employee,\u201d but this too fails.  It says that under the common law, \u201ca permanent employee is one \nwho is guaranteed a position with an employer so long as the employee\u2019s work is satisfactory and the employer continues to engage in work that requires the employee\u2019s job functions.\u201d  Id. at",

The Commission is scheduled to terminate on a specific date, see 2020 NDAA, Pub. L.

Instead, they are \u201cintermittent\u201d employees.  EPIC points to a regulation stating that \u201c[a]n intermittent work schedule is \nappropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty cannot be regularly scheduled in advance.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s Mem. at 18 (quoting 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 340.403(a)). This regulation explicitly distinguishes \u201cintermittent\u201d status from \u201cpart-time\u201d status, as it says \nthat \u201c[w]hen an agency is able to schedule work in advance on a regular basis, it has an obligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part-time or full-time to \nensure proper service credit.\u201d  5 C.F.R. \u00a7 340.403(a).

      "Because the Commission is an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d that must comply with FACA\u2019s \nrequirements, EPIC\u2019s entitlement to mandamus relief is straightforward.  The party seeking mandamus has the burden of showing \u201c(1) a clear and indisputable right to relief, (2) that the \ngovernment agency or official is violating a clear duty to act, and (3) that no adequate alternative remedy exists.\u201d  Am.

Indeed, the Government makes no \nargument for why, if the Commission is subject to FACA, there would not be \u201ccompelling",
      "equitable grounds\u201d for relief.  Other than an argument that EPIC has an adequate alternative \nremedy in the APA and an argument that EPIC did not adequately plead mandamus claims, which the Court addresses infra, the Government\u2019s arguments against mandamus focus \nexclusively on its belief that the Commission is just not subject to FACA in the first place.  See Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 18\u201324; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 18\u201320, 18 n.6. 13  For the first element of mandamus, the Government invokes the doctrine of \u201cjudicial \nestoppel.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 22\u201324.

      "render a residential premises \u201cuninhabitable.\u201d  These conditions \ninclude lack of heating, lack of running water, and lack of working \nlocks, but not animal odors or urine stains. Al-Hamim argues in his opening brief that the landlords \nbreached the warranty of habitability by failing to replace the \ncarpeting in his apartment.  Specifically, he asserts that his \u201cinability to use his bedroom due to severe allergies\u201d constituted the \nbreach.  In his complaint, however, he did not allege that he was unable to use the bedroom.  Further, in his opening brief, \nAl-Hamim does not cite any authority indicating that the problems \nhe experienced at the apartment made it \u201cuninhabitable\u201d within the meaning of sections 38-12-503(2)(a)(I) and 38-12-505(1). \n \nNor did Al-Hamim allege a plausible claim that the conditions at the apartment materially interfered with his \u201clife, health, or \nsafety.\u201d  \u00a7 38-12-503(2)(a)(II).  We focus on the \u201chealth\u201d prong of the 8 \nstatute because Al-Hamim did not allege that the cat odor or urine \nstains affected his life or safety.  Viewing the allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to Al-Hamim, see Jagged Peak \nEnergy Inc., , 523 P.3d at 446, his allegation that the cat urine",
      "smell and stains impacted his health rested on his assertion that he \n\u201cbegan to show signs of an allergic reaction when emptying the [vacuum] canister\u201d on the day he moved in.  He did not allege in his \ncomplaint that the \u201csigns of an allergic reaction\u201d materially impacted his health, that the allergic reaction continued past the \nday he vacuumed the carpet, or that the smell and stains impacted his health in any other manner.

      "Al-Hamim alleged that \u201c[t]he landlord[s\u2019] refusal to replace the \ncat-urine-stained carpet, despite repeated complaints . . . , resulted in a significant disruption to [his] quiet enjoyment of the \napartment.\u201d  He asserted that the landlords breached the implied \ncovenant of quiet enjoyment because the issues involving the carpet resulted in \u201cinconvenience and strain\u201d on his friendships with his \ncotenants, and that he and his cotenants \u201chad not actually moved into and settled into the premises\u201d during the first year of the lease.   \n \nIt is unclear from Al-Hamim\u2019s complaint the extent to which \nthe condition of the carpet interfered with his quiet enjoyment of the premises, as opposed to his relationship with his cotenants, \nhowever.  Al-Hamim did not allege that he was unable to use any part of the premises due to the carpet\u2019s condition.  Rather, \nAl-Hamim said that he refrained from moving items into his \napartment because he did not want to have to move them again when the carpet was replaced, not because any room was unfit for \n \n11 \noccupancy.  (In his response to the landlords\u2019 motion to dismiss and in the opening brief, Al-Hamim argued that the carpet problems \nprevented him from using his bedroom.  However, he did not \ninclude this allegation in his complaint and, therefore, we do not",

      "facts alleged in the pleadings, documents attached as exhibits or \nincorporated by reference, and matters proper for judicial notice.\u201d).) \n \nFurther, Al-Hamim does not cite any legal authority holding that a strain on cotenants\u2019 relationships can result in a breach of \nthe implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.  Nor did Al-Hamim allege \nthat the carpet odor and staining resulted in a constructive eviction. To the contrary, Al-Hamim conceded in his complaint that he \nrenewed the lease despite his complaints about the carpet.  For these reasons, Al-Hamim did not allege the type of \u201cdisturbance \nof . . . possession\u201d that could render the apartment unfit for \u201cthe purposes for which [it was] leased.\u201d  W. Stock Ctr., Inc., 578 P.2d at \n1051 (quoting Radinsky, 460 P.2d at 220). Accordingly, we conclude that Al-Hamim failed to state a claim \nfor breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment. \n \n12 \nD. \nOther Issues Al-Hamim raises the following claims for the first time in his \nopening brief:  \n\u2022 \nThe landlords \u201cbreached the lease agreement and the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by failing to resolve maintenance issues and by conducting \narbitrary credit checks.\u201d  \n\u2022 \n\u201c[T]he leasing agent made fraudulent representations \nregarding the credit check process and the legality of a",

      "In this interlocutory appeal, defendant Chad Readey appeals a trial judge\u2019s order denying \ndefendant\u2019s motion to reconsider and, in the alternative, vacate another judge\u2019s order, which",
      "permitted plaintiff to proceed under a fictitious name. For the following reasons, we affirm the \nsecond judge\u2019s1 denial of said motion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBACKGROUND On December 29, 2022, plaintiff filed a one-page, three-paragraph \u201cPetition to File a \nLawsuit Using a Fictitious Name.\u201d The petition stated in full: \u201cPursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-401 [(West 2022)], plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through her attorney, seeks leave to file a complaint under a fictitious name. In support of this \nmotion, plaintiff states: 1. Under 735 ILCS 5/2-401 [(West 2022)], a party may appear under a fictitious \nname \u2018for good cause shown.\u2019 2. Plaintiff here has good cause: Plaintiff was sexually assaulted, as a minor, by \ndefendant, which is a matter that is highly personal, private and sensitive. It is a source of humiliation and shame that she did not bring on herself. Plaintiff does not wish to be \npublicly branded as a victim of sexual abuse. 3. Given all this, plaintiff\u2019s interest in protecting her identity outweighs any interest \nthe public may have in knowing it. \n \nWHEREFORE plaintiff respectfully requests the Court permit her to file her",
      "lawsuit under a fictitious name.\u201d \nSection 2-401(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) provides: \u201cUpon application and for good cause shown the parties may appear under fictitious names.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/2-401(e) (West \n2022). On December 29, 2022, the trial court issued a one-page, five-paragraph order that stated \nin full: \u201cThis matter coming to be heard on Plaintiff\u2019s Petition to Proceed Under a Fictitious \nName, the Court being fully advised and having heard argument, the Court finds as \nfollows: Pursuant to In re Marriage of Johnson, 232 Ill. App. 3d 1068 (4th Dist. 1992), the",
      "Court has balanced Plaintiff\u2019s right to privacy against the public\u2019s right of access to \nopen court proceedings. Plaintiff contends she has a compelling interest because she was a victim of sexual abuse, which is highly personal, private and sensitive. \n \nThe Court finds there is a compelling interest that favors Plaintiff\u2019s right to privacy in keeping her name from the public and such right is superior to the public\u2019s right of access to an open proceeding. See Doe v. Doe, 282 Ill. App. 3d 1078, 1088 (1st Dist. \n1996). 1The Honorable Israel Desierto.  \n \n- 3 - \n \n \nThe Court further finds that the privacy issue involved shall be protected in the least restrictive way possible. The Court finds that the least restrictive way to protect the \nprivacy of Plaintiff is allowing her to proceed under a fictitious name. The order may be reconsidered if Plaintiff takes any steps to make her name known \nto the public and shall be reconsidered by the trial judge at the time of jury selection. Plaintiff shall file a copy of the Complaint with her actual name under seal with the \nClerk of the Court and to remain under seal until further order of the Court.\u201d",
      "On December 29, 2022, plaintiff filed a two-count complaint against defendant, alleging (1) a violation of the Gender Violence Act (740 ILCS 82/1 et seq. (West 2020)) and \n(2) intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff alleged that defendant sexually harassed and assaulted her while they were both students in high school. \n \n \nThe complaint further alleged that, during the 2019-20 school year, six female high-school students reported to the dean\u2019s office that defendant had engaged in sexually abusive conduct \ntoward them; that the high school opened an investigation into \u201ctheir star-student athlete\u201d; that plaintiff did not report defendant at that time, although she did discuss his conduct with close \nfamily and friends; that high school officials called her into their office and took a statement from her; that other classmates (but not plaintiff) publicly exposed the allegations against \ndefendant on social media; that, in July 2022, defendant filed a defamation lawsuit against several classmates (but not plaintiff); and that, since filing suit, defendant threatened to add \nplaintiff to his defamation suit.2 In support of the last allegation, plaintiff attached a letter from defendant\u2019s counsel, dated December 14, 2022, which stated that defendant would add her to \nhis defamation suit by December 30, 2022, unless she contacted him before December 21 to",
      "discuss \u201calternatives.\u201d The letter further stated: \u201cYou are advised to promptly obtain legal \ncounsel.\u201d Plaintiff filed her petition on December 29, the day before defendant threatened to",
      "name her as a defendant in his suit.3 \n \n \nThe timestamps on plaintiff\u2019s petition to proceed anonymously, plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and \nthe trial court\u2019s order permitting the petition indicate that all three documents were filed together at exactly 12:31 p.m. on December 29, 2022. \n \n \nOn January 10, 2023, defendant waived service of process, when his counsel executed a form \u201cAcknowledgment of Receipt of Summons and Complaint,\u201d declaring under penalty of \nperjury that he had received a copy. On January 12, 2023, defendant filed an appearance in this action through his counsel.  \n \n \nOn March 29, 2023, defendant filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint,\u201d alleging two separate and independent grounds. First, defendant sought dismissal \u201cbecause\u201d plaintiff \n\u201cfiled suit under a fictitious name without the Court\u2019s permission\u201d and, thus, violated section 2-401(e). Second, defendant sought dismissal \u201cbecause\u201d plaintiff \u201ccannot establish good cause \nafter the fact,\u201d where she signed an affidavit in her own name in another case, in which she 2According to the complaint, the counsel who sent her a threatening letter is the same counsel who \nrepresents defendant in the case below and on this appeal. 3Plaintiff\u2019s brief alleges that defendant added her on January 6, 2023, as a named defendant to his \ndefamation action, and defendant does not dispute this allegation.  \n \n- 4 -",
      "was not a party, but which contained similar allegations to her complaint here.4 The seven-\nparagraph \u201cArgument\u201d section of defendant\u2019s motion was divided equally between the two grounds, with the first paragraph quoting the statute, and the next three paragraphs arguing the \nfirst ground, and the following three paragraphs arguing the second ground. With respect to",
      "any argument by plaintiff that she had cause to file anonymously, defendant asserted that \n\u201c[t]his argument is meritless,\u201d and he marshalled case law and attached exhibits in support of this point. The heading of his March 29 motion named a trial judge (the Honorable Daniel A. \nTrevino), who was different than the judge (the Honorable James P. Flannery) who had issued the original December 29, 2022, order. His March 29 motion also contains a \u201cCertificate of \nService\u201d on the last page stating that defendant\u2019s counsel served a copy on plaintiff\u2019s counsel by e-mail on March 29.  \n \n \nDefendant\u2019s motion further alleged that plaintiff\u2019s counsel published \u201cJane Doe[\u2019s]\u201d allegations on counsel\u2019s website. In support, defendant attached a printout that he alleged was \nprinted from plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s website and that indicates that it was printed on January 23, 2023.5 The text of the printout states that, \u201c[t]oday,\u201d December 29, 2022, \u201cJane Doe filed a complaint\u201d against defendant, and it describes her allegations against defendant. Defendant\u2019s \nmotion stated that, although the allegations were no longer on her counsel\u2019s website as of March 13, 2023, it had become the source of other Internet articles. In support of his claim that \nher counsel\u2019s website was the source of other articles, he attached what he alleged was the first",
      "page of a Google search for his name, which listed five entries. The first three entries refer \nfavorably to his profile as a baseball player, and the fourth and fifth entries refer to his",
      "defamation suit. While the fourth entry is headlined \u201cNorthwestern baseball player sued for \nintentional infliction of,\u201d the text for that entry states: \u201cFor over two years, Chad Readey has been the victim of a vicious, coordinated effort to assassinate his character based on \nfalsehoods.\u201d Similarly, while the fifth entry is headlined \u201cGender Violence Lawsuit: HFHS Grad Sues Northwestern\u2019s,\u201d the text for this entry states: \u201cThe player\u2014Chad Readey, of \nFlossmoor\u2014has also filed a defamation lawsuit against several classmates who took to the university\u2019s social.\u201d  \n \n \nOn April 13, 2023, two weeks after his dismissal motion, defendant filed a second and",
      "separate motion entitled \u201cMotion to Reconsider and In the Alternative to Vacate,\u201d which \nnamed Judge Flannery, the author of the December 29 order. In his prayer for relief, defendant asked \u201cthis Court to reconsider the December 29, 2022[,] order and deny Plaintiff\u2019s petition \nand, in the alternative, to vacate the order.\u201d Like defendant\u2019s first motion, this second motion also alleged (1) that plaintiff violated section 2-401(e) and (2) that she lacked good cause to \nfile anonymously because she signed an affidavit in her own name in another case with similar allegations. The April 13 motion contains a \u201cCertificate of Service\u201d stating that it was served \non plaintiff\u2019s counsel by e-mail on April 13. 4The affidavit was submitted in support of a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by defendant against \nother parties. The affidavit is dated September 6, 2022, which was three months before defendant\u2019s letter on December 14, 2022, telling plaintiff to get an attorney. \n \n5Three of the five pages are cut off at the top, and the page numbers in the bottom right-hand corner indicate that the pages are not in sequential order. For example, the first page states \u201c1/9\u201d while the \nsecond page states \u201c4/11\u201d and the third page states \u201c2/9.\u201d - 5 - \n \n \n \nDefendant\u2019s April 13 motion alleged that plaintiff sent defendant a copy of the December",
      "29, 2022, order on April 6, 2023, but the motion did not allege that this was the first he learned of the December 29 order. The motion further alleged that the December 29 order was \ninjunctive but not a temporary restraining order. On April 19, 2023, Judge Trevino issued an order setting forth a briefing schedule on \ndefendant\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss and Motion to Stay\u201d and required defendant to e-mail a Word or PDF file with all briefs, exhibits, and relevant documents to the court by 11 a.m. on May \n24, 2023. Although the order refers to a motion to stay, the limited supporting records filed in this appeal by both parties do not contain a motion to stay. Additionally, our supporting record \ndoes not contain plaintiff\u2019s response brief or other documents showing whether the March 29 motion to dismiss was heard or decided or whether the briefing schedule was adhered to. \nNevertheless, plaintiff\u2019s appellate brief alleges that she filed her responsive brief, which was due by May 9; that defendant did not file his reply which was due by May 23; and that the \nMarch 29 motion is still pending. Defendant does not dispute these allegations. On April 20, 2023, defendant filed a \u201cResponse to Plaintiff\u2019s Request for Admission,\u201d in \nwhich he objected to plaintiff\u2019s request for admission \u201cbecause motions to dismiss and to stay",
      "discovery are pending and subject to a briefing schedule set by Court order.\u201d  \n \n \nOn April 25, 2023, yet a third trial judge, the Honorable Israel Desierto, issued a one- sentence order, which defendant alleges is the basis for jurisdiction of this appeal. Judge \nDesierto was neither the judge who issued the original December 29 order nor the judge who issued the scheduling order for defendant\u2019s prior motion. While the record before us does not \ncontain a written response to the motion by plaintiff, the order was issued 12 days after \ndefendant\u2019s motion was filed. The April 25 order stated in full: \n \n\u201cThis cause coming to be heard before the court on motion of Defendant to Reconsider the order entered pursuant to Section 2-401(a) of the Illinois Code of Civil \nProcedure on December 29, 2022, both parties present through counsel, with the Court properly advised on the premise[s], IT IS HEREBY ORDERED Defendant\u2019s motion \nis denied.\u201d  \nDefendant\u2019s counsel drafted the order, which was ostensibly against his interest. The order does not state the reasons for the denial6 or whether the order was in anticipation of the \nresolution of defendant\u2019s soon-to-be fully briefed dismissal motion. The order also does not mention defendant\u2019s alternate motion to vacate. The one-line order was handwritten on a form \nwith defendant\u2019s attorney listed as the drafting attorney.7",
      "On May 15, 2023, defendant filed an interlocutory notice of appeal stating that he was \nappealing the order entered on April 25, 2023, pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 307(a)(1) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017).  \n \n \n \n6Typically, a protective order is subject to an abuse-of-discretion standard of review, and a reviewing court considers the trial court\u2019s stated reasons for refusing to vacate when deciding whether the trial court did, or did not, abuse that discretion. Skolnick v. Altheimer & Gray, 191 Ill. 2d 214, 226 (2000). Here, the losing party apparently drafted the order without any stated reasons, although a lack of stated reasons may itself be a ground for reversal. Skolnick, 191 Ill. 2d at 226. \n \n7Plaintiff\u2019s appellate brief states that the order was drafted by defendant\u2019s attorney.",
      "- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \n \nANALYSIS \n \n \n \n \n \nI. Jurisdiction The first issue we must resolve is whether, as plaintiff argues, we lack jurisdiction to hear",
      "this appeal. People v. Brindley, 2017 IL App (5th) 160189,  (\u201c[t]he first issue we must \naddress is the jurisdiction of this court to hear\u201d the appeal). A. Court of Limited Jurisdiction \n \n \nAs an appellate court, our jurisdiction is limited, and those limits are expressly set forth in our state\u2019s constitution. The Illinois Constitution provides appellate courts with the jurisdiction \nor authority to review final judgments entered by a trial court. Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6. Specifically, section 6 provides that \u201c[a]ppeals from final judgments of a Circuit Court are a matter of right to the Appellate Court.\u201d Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6. As a result, an appeal to this court is generally taken only after a trial court has resolved all claims against all parties in \nan action. Ely v. Pivar, 2018 IL App (1st) 170626, . However, section 6 of article VI also provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court may provide by \nrule for appeals to the Appellate Court from other than final judgments of Circuit Courts.\u201d Ill. Const. 1970, art. VI, \u00a7 6. Thus, when we are presented with a nonfinal judgment, our authority \nto hear that appeal is based solely on what our supreme court has permitted us to hear under",
      "its rules. EMC Mortgage Corp. v. Kemp, 2012 IL 113419,  (\u201cabsent a supreme court rule, \nthe appellate court is without jurisdiction to review\u201d nonfinal orders). If we lack jurisdiction, we must dismiss the appeal. In re Barion S., 2012 IL App (1st) 113026,  (if we determine \nwe lack jurisdiction, we must dismiss the appeal). B. Standard of Review \n \n \nWhether or not we, as an appellate court, have subject matter jurisdiction over an appeal is a matter that we consider de novo. See In re Estate of Hughes, 2020 IL App (5th) 190390, ; Todd v. Chaviano, 2019 IL App (5th) 170081, . \u201c[T]his issue, by its very nature, is one that the trial court did not consider and, thus, we review it de novo or on a blank slate.\u201d People \nv.

      "C. Statute at Issue \n \n \nThe appellant here asserts jurisdiction under Rule 307, which provides, in relevant part: \u201c(a) Orders Appealable; Time.

      "Defendant argued in the \u201cstatement of jurisdiction\u201d (Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(4) (eff. Oct. 1, 2020)) section of his initial brief:8 (1) that the April 25, 2023, order was an interlocutory order refusing to dissolve an injunction, pursuant to Rule 307(a)(1); (2) that, pursuant to subsection (a), the appeal from the April 25 order had to be perfected within 30 days; and (3) that \ndefendant did just that by filing a notice of appeal on May 15, 2023.9 In her appellate brief, plaintiff argued that subsection (b) of Rule 307 governs here. \nSubsection (b) states that it applies when \u201can interlocutory order is entered on ex parte application,\u201d which is what happened in the case at bar. Ill. S. Ct. R. 307(b) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017). The first line of subsection (b) states, in full: \u201cIf an interlocutory order is entered on ex parte \napplication, the party intending to take an appeal therefrom shall first present, on notice, a motion to the trial court to vacate the order.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 307(b) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017). Plaintiff",
      "seems to interpret this line to mean that, when the challenging party is first \u201con notice\u201d of the \nex parte order, it must present a motion to the trial court to vacate the order, and she argues that defendant failed to act in a timely fashion. Plaintiff appears to be arguing that the phrase \n\u201con notice\u201d refers to when the party must present the motion, as opposed to how the motion \nshould be presented. We do not read the rule that way. The phrase \u201con notice\u201d modifies the word it immediately \nfollows, namely, \u201cpresent,\u201d and requires the presentation of the vacating motion to be \u201con notice.\u201d The word \u201con\u201d is used as a preposition to indicate that the notice is in contact with or \nsupported by something else: in this case the \u201cmotion\u201d not the \u201cex parte order.\u201d Thus, in the case at bar, the vacating motion appears to be on notice, since the motion itself contained a \ncertificate of service, and the resulting order stated that both parties were present through \ncounsel. We acknowledge that it is odd to impose a strict 30-day time limit in subsection (a) and \nthen, in subsection (b), seemingly permit another party to sit on its hands for weeks or months without limit after learning about an ex parte order. We recognize that a good argument could \nhave been made that interpreting the two subsections as a unified whole might possibly require finding that a party, who intends to take an appeal from an ex parte order, must first present a \nmotion to vacate within 30 days of learning of that order. However, plaintiff here did not make",
      "such an argument, and she does not offer any case law, cites to secondary sources, dictionaries \nor grammatical texts, arguments by analogy, or other citations, except for the mere assertion",
      "that defendant failed to move in a timely fashion after he was \u201con notice\u201d of the ex parte order. \nA reviewing court is entitled to have issues clearly defined with relevant authority cited. Lozman v. Putnam, 379 Ill. App. 3d 807, 824 (2008). It is not necessary to decide an issue where a party has waived the issue by failing to offer case citation or other support. Lozman, 379 Ill.

      "not argued are waived). \n \n \nIt is apparent from the record before us, that the following facts are beyond dispute: (1) that the December 29 order was injunctive as contemplated by Rule 307(a)(1); (2) that the \nDecember 29 order was an interlocutory order entered ex parte, as contemplated by Rule 307(b); (3) that defendant moved on April 13, 2023, to reconsider the December 29 order and in the alternative to vacate it; (4) that the trial court entered an order on April 25 stating that defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto Reconsider\u201d was denied; and (5) that defendant filed a notice of appeal on May 15, which was within 30 days of the April 25 order. Based on these undisputed facts, \nwe find that we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the April 25 order. II. Standard of Review and the Appellate Record \n \n \nHaving found jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we turn to the substantive issues before us, starting first with the appropriate standard of review. It is well established that a refusal to \nmodify an order protecting information from disclosure is subject to an abuse-of-discretion",
      "standard of review. Skolnick, 191 Ill. 2d at 224; Doe No. 1 v. Northwestern Memorial Hospital, 2014 IL App (1st) 140212,  (a trial court\u2019s order permitting or denying a party the ability \nto proceed anonymously under section 2-401(e) will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion). An abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial court\u2019s decision is arbitrary, \nfanciful, or unreasonable to the degree that no reasonable person would agree with it. People v. Woodson, 2023 IL App (1st) 191353, . In determining whether the trial court abused \nits discretion, a reviewing court looks to the trial court\u2019s \u201cstated justification for refusing to modify\u201d the order. Skolnick, 191 Ill. 2d at 226. In the case at bar, the one-sentence April 25 order did not provide any reasons at all. The \nlosing party drafted the order without any stated reasons, although a lack of stated reasons may itself be a ground for reversal\u2014i.e., for his winning a reversal on appeal. In light of this \nanomaly, we cannot find that a lack of stated reasons constitutes an abuse of discretion here. Where no transcript or bystander\u2019s report of the proceedings was provided to us, and where \nno reasons were stated in the order itself, we presume that the trial court acted appropriately",
      "and that the reasons for its denial were provided on the record. Corral v. Mervis Industries, Inc., 217 Ill. 2d 144, 157 (2005) (\u201cWithout an adequate record preserving the claimed error, \nthe reviewing court must presume the circuit court had a sufficient factual basis for its holding and that its order conforms with the law.\u201d). In her brief to us, plaintiff argues, \u201cDefendant\u2019s \ncounsel now cannot fairly contend that the trial court did not consider all the facts, especially when [d]efendant\u2019s counsel offers no court transcript to show otherwise.\u201d On appeal, it is \ngenerally the appellant\u2019s burden to provide the reviewing court with a sufficient record to establish the error that he complains of. Webster v. Hartman, 195 Ill. 2d 426, 436 (2001). \u201c[A] reviewing court cannot look beyond the record and speculate on what may have occurred in \nthe trial court.\u201d Webster, 195 Ill. 2d at 436. \u201cA court of review is limited to the record before it.\u201d Webster, 195 Ill. 2d at 436. We \u201cwill not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision on the basis of speculation and conjecture.\u201d Webster, 195 Ill. 2d at 435.  \n \n \nDefendant\u2019s motion to reconsider or vacate made factual allegations that a trial court may",
      "have needed to resolve before deciding the motion. For example, defendant\u2019s motion alleged \nthat \u201cthe facts establish that [p]laintiff not only made her identity known to the public before she petitioned the Court to appear under a fictitious name, she also made the material \n \n- 9 - \n \nallegations in her complaint known to the public through an affidavit executed and filed in her own name.\u201d Defendant then cited her attached affidavit, which states, among other things, that \nthe abuse she received from defendant empowered her \u201cto help start a podcast relating to not accepting abuse from men.\u201d We do not know how the trial court resolved the factual issue \nregarding the degree to which plaintiff had publicized her name. We do not know what plaintiff argued before the trial court in response to defendant\u2019s motion, since neither her written \nresponse (if she filed one)10 nor a transcript of the hearing is in the record before us. Without this information, it is impossible for us to find an abuse of discretion by the trial court for \nallegedly failing to vacate the original order. In addition, defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider cited Doe v. Cook County, Illinois, 542 F. Supp. 3d 779, 785 (N.D. Ill. 2021), for the proposition that a party who has already made her",
      "name known to the public cannot establish good cause, and his appellate brief argues that at \nleast six of the Doe factors favor him. First, Doe provided a \u201cnon-exhaustive\u201d list of 13 factors that federal courts had previously considered to determine whether a party could proceed \nanonymously in federal court. Doe, 542 F. Supp. 3d at 785 (identifying 13 factors that federal courts had considered, including \u201c[w]hether the movant\u2019s identity has been disclosed to the \npublic or kept confidential\u201d). If plaintiff\u2019s identity was already known to the public, this factor would weigh in defendant\u2019s favor. However, a number of the other federal factors listed by \nDoe would appear to weigh in plaintiff\u2019s favor, including (1) \u201c[w]hether the case involves a highly sensitive and personal matter or requires the disclosure of the utmost intimacy,\u201d \n(2) \u201cwhether denying the motion would increase the likelihood that similarly situated plaintiffs would be chilled from bringing similar claims,\u201d and (3) \u201c[w]hether the movant is a minor, or was a minor at the time of the conduct at issue.\u201d Doe, 542 F. Supp. 3d at 785. Without knowing \nwhat factors the trial court considered or how it weighed and balanced the factors it did",
      "consider, we cannot find it abused its discretion. The place to resolve factual disputes is in the \ntrial court, not a court of review. Since we lack a sufficient record to evaluate the trial court\u2019s action in denying defendant\u2019s \nmotion, we cannot find an abuse of discretion and must affirm. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to vacate \nthe injunctive order.  \n \n \n \nAffirmed. 10As we already noted above, the record does not indicate, one way or the other, whether plaintiff filed a written response, and the order was issued just 12 days after defendant\u2019s motion was filed. Supra \n. If plaintiff did not file a response, that makes the need for a transcript even more clear. The trial court\u2019s order stated that it was fully advised. By process of elimination, the only place that would reflect \nwhat the court was fully advised of, if no response was filed, would be in a transcript or bystander\u2019s report.  \n \n- 10 - \n \n \n \nJUSTICE HYMAN, specially concurring:",
      "I agree with the majority\u2019s decision. I write separately to address the rights of an alleged \nvictim of sexual violence to proceed anonymously with a complaint under the Gender Violence Act. 740 ILCS 82/1 et seq. (West 2020).  \n \n \nIn a world where the Internet already has created privacy, confidentiality, and security issues, we now enter the age of artificial intelligence, exacerbating these issues and making \nsecrecy vital. No longer, in famous observation of Justice Brandeis almost 100 years ago, is \u201cright to be let alone\u201d enough. Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). In the twenty-first century, the right to be left unknown will join the right to be \nlet alone as a vexing subject of intense legal debate. Indeed, the question of anonymity has taken on increased significance as court records \nhave become readily available to the general public through even casual Internet searches. As the appellant notes in his brief, a Google search of a litigant\u2019s name can produce an untold \nnumber of articles describing the lawsuit. Those articles may be available online for a lifetime, \nunless kept confidential. Although Illinois case law offers slight guidance on petitions to proceed anonymously, an \nalleged victim deserves anonymity whether or not their identity has been divulged elsewhere, \nincluding in a case not brought by them.",
      "Good Cause Under Section 2-401 \n \n \nBecause of the presumption of openness in judicial proceedings (Chicago Tribune Co. v. Cook County Assessor\u2019s Office, 2018 IL App (1st) 170455, ), the law disfavors suing or defending under a pseudonym in that the identity of the parties relates to the public nature of civil judicial proceedings. A.P. v. M.E.E., 354 Ill. App. 3d 989, 1003 (2004) (citing Doe v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisconsin, 112 F.3d 869, 872 (7th Cir. 1997)). Thus, generally, parties for whom a pleading seeks relief are identified by name. 735 ILCS 5/2-401(c) (West \n2020). Section 2-401(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure provides an exception. This section allows \na party to appear under a fictitious name on application and for good cause. 735 ILCS 5/2- 401(e) (West 2020).

Whether a plaintiff\u2019s particular situation amounts to \u201cexceptional\u201d is determined on a case-by-case basis. Doe No. 1 v. Northwestern Memorial \nHospital, 2014 IL App (1st) 140212, . The fundamental question involves whether the moving party has shown a privacy interest outweighing the public\u2019s interest in open judicial \nproceedings. Doe, 282 Ill. App. 3d at 1088. The standard of review for the trial court\u2019s determination stands, absent an abuse of discretion. Northwestern Memorial Hospital, 2014 IL \nApp (1st) 140212, . Although no reported Illinois cases address whether a claim of sexual violence constitutes \nan \u201cexceptional\u201d situation warranting the use of a pseudonym, federal courts in Illinois have recognized that allegations of sexual assault are \u201chighly sensitive, personal matters that involve \nthe disclosure of information of the utmost intimacy.\u201d Doe v. Cook County, 542 F. Supp. 3d",

Kolko, 242 F.R.D. 193, 195 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (while the Seventh Circuit disfavors fictitious names, it has \u201crecognized that sexual assault \nvictims are a paradigmatic example of those entitled to a grant of anonymity\u201d (citing Doe, 112 F.3d at 872)). Even so, a sexual violence allegation alone has been considered not dispositive. See Cook County, 542 F. Supp. 3d at 786 (\u201callegation of sexual assault alone does not end the inquiry\u201d); Doe v. Skyline Automobiles, Inc., 375 F. Supp. 3d 401, 405-06 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (\u201cother factors must be taken into consideration and analyzed in comparison to the public\u2019s \ninterest and the interests of the opposing parties\u201d).",
      "Illinois has taken steps to protect individuals\u2019 private information. Examples include the \nPersonal Information Protection Act (815 ILCS 530/1 et seq. (West 2022)), the Biometric Information Privacy Act (740 ILCS 14/1 et seq. (West 2022)), and two laws regulating data \nobtained by artificial intelligence, the Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (820 ILCS 42/5 (West 2022)) and the Illinois Health Statistics Act (410 ILCS 520/1 et seq. (West 2022)). Nonetheless, the law cannot keep pace with the speed of innovations, compromising privacy. \nCorinne Moini, Protecting Privacy in the Era of Smart Toys: Does Hello Barbie Have a Duty to Report?, 25 Cath. U.J.L. & Tech. 281, 299 (2017) (asserting that privacy torts do not provide \nadequate protection for privacy implications of artificial intelligence and data collection).",
      "When methods of intruding into private lives and stripping anonymity outpace lawmakers\u2019 \nability to address them, courts have a duty under existing rules of procedure to protect sexual \nassault and abuse victims. Plaintiff, a minor when the alleged sexual assault occurred, undeniably constitutes an \n\u201cexceptional\u201d situation. The lawsuit involves matters of a highly personal nature warranting anonymity. Indeed, Illinois Supreme Court rules acknowledge the need for anonymity in cases \ninvolving minors. For instance, the Illinois Supreme Court rules provide that minors shall be identified by first name and last initial or by initials in adoption cases (Ill. S. Ct. R. 663 (eff. Oct. 1, 2001)) and appeals involving the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/1 et seq. (West 2022)). Ill. S. Ct. R. 660(c) (eff. Oct. 1, 2001). Moreover, the Style Manual for the Supreme and Appellate Courts of Illinois (5th ed. rev. 2017) provides for using the minor\u2019s \ninitials in cases involving the Department of Children and Family Services. These rules reflect the need to protect the identity of a minor in matters of a personal nature that involve potentially \nstigmatizing issues such as termination of parental rights or juvenile criminal conduct.",
      "An alleged victim of sexual violence has similar reasons for protecting their identity when \nfiling a lawsuit under the Gender Violence Act. The alleged conduct involves highly personal conduct likely to embarrass and stigmatize, regardless of its availability on the Internet. Thus, \nI would find that an alleged victim has a compelling reason to proceed anonymously when filing a complaint. Similarly, an accused perpetrator should be able to seek anonymity on \npetition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWaiver The appellant contends that Doe waived her right to proceed anonymously because she \nfiled an affidavit supporting a motion to dismiss the defamation lawsuit the appellant filed against his other accusers. (The appellant added Doe as a defendant in the defamation litigation \nafter she filed her complaint.) I must disagree that she waived her right. When Doe filed the affidavit in the defamation case, she had yet to file her complaint \nagainst defendant. The decision to help another litigant should not bar an individual from \n \n- 12 - proceeding anonymously in their own lawsuit, regardless of an affidavit in another proceeding. \nFiling suit creates a different level of exposure than filing an affidavit in support of others.",
      "Imposing waiver would chill alleged victims of sexual violence from coming forward, \nthereby undermining Illinois policy. For example, the Sexual Assault Incident Procedure Act (725 ILCS 203/15 (West 2020)) requires Illinois law enforcement agencies to develop and \nimplement written policies for responding to sex crimes using evidence-based, trauma- informed, and victim-centered protocols. In addition, laws protect college students who survive \nsexual violence from public disclosure of communications they make in confidence to confidential advisors (735 ILCS 5/8-804(c) (West 2022)) and prohibit hospitals treating sexual \nassault victims from directly billing the victims for the services, communicating with victims about a bill, or referring overdue bills to collection agencies or credit reporting agencies. 410 \nILCS 70/7.5(a)(1)-(4) (West 2022). These recently enacted laws encourage victims to report sexual violence. Yet, should a victim waive anonymity by assisting another alleged victim, the \nintent of these laws would be thwarted. An alleged victim of sexual violence should not have to choose between assisting others in the legal process and their privacy in their case."

      "of Defense seeking \u201crecords pertaining to the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team\u2019s use \nof Google technology, software or hardware,\u201d from January 1, 2017, to March 6, 2018.  The De-",
      "partment identified about 5,000 pages of responsive records, but it withheld them all under FOIA Exemptions 3, 4, 5, and 6.   After several internal remands, the Department affirmed its decision",
      "to withhold the records.  Biddle sued, and the parties now cross-move for summary judgment.  See \nECF Nos. 14, 17. The Department argues that the information was properly withheld under Exemption 3, \nwhich exempts information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.  In doing so, the Department relies on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e, which allows it to withhold \u201ccritical infrastructure \nsecurity information.\u201d  The Department does not seek to justify its withholdings under any other exemption in its motion, but notes that it \u201creserves the right to review and withhold all exempt \ninformation under other applicable exemptions including, but not limited to, FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, and 6.\u201d  ECF No. 14 at 3 n.2.  In response, Biddle argues that the Department has improperly invoked Exemption 3 because the relevant statute does not apply to the information it withheld, \n \n \n2\nthe Department\u2019s affidavit is inadequate, and the Department\u2019s segregability analysis is insuffi- cient.  He also asserts that he is entitled to summary judgment because the Department has waived \nits right to invoke the other FOIA exemptions and that, in any event, those exemptions provide no \nbasis for withholding the information. For the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that the affidavit the Department has sup-\nplied does not provide enough information to determine whether it properly applied Exemption 3.",
      "Thus, the Court will deny both parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment without prejudice and per-\nmit them to file renewed motions consistent with this Memorandum Order.  Moreover, in any such renewed motion, in the interests of judicial economy, the Department will be required to assert, in \naddition to Exemption 3, any other exemption that it relies on to withhold the records. In FOIA cases in which an agency invokes any FOIA exemption, the \u201cburden is on the \nagency to justify withholding the requested documents, and the FOIA directs district courts to",
      "determine de novo whether non-disclosure was permissible.\u201d  EPIC v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 777 F.3d 518, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  When conducting its de novo review, a court may grant summary judgment based on the agency\u2019s declarations if the \u201caffidavit describes the justifications \nfor withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the \nrecord or by evidence of the agency's bad faith.\u201d  Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011).   That is, the agency must provide a \u201clogical\u201d or \u201cplausible\u201d justi- fication for the exemption, Larson v. Dep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C.

Circuit explained, agencies must submit sufficiently de-",
      "tailed and specific affidavits for at least three purposes: \u201cit forces the government to analyze \n \n \n3 carefully any material withheld, it enables the trial court to fulfill its duty of ruling on the applica-\nbility of the exemption, and it enables the adversary system to operate by giving the requester as much information as possible, on the basis of which he can present his case to the trial court.\u201d Lykins v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  The withholding agency \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the \nconsequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d  King v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That information \u201cis necessary to ensure meaningful review of an \nagency\u2019s claim to withhold information subject to a FOIA request.\u201d  Id. at 223. The Department invokes Exemption 3, which applies to information that is exempted from \ndisclosure by statute.  Unlike other FOIA exemptions, Exemption 3 \u201cdepends less on the detailed factual contents of specific documents; the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant \nstatute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statute\u2019s coverage.\u201d   Morley, 508 F.3d at",
      "1126 (citation omitted).  As noted, the Department relies on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e, which permits the \nwithholding of \u201ccritical infrastructure security information.\u201d  The statute defines that information as:  \nsensitive but unclassified information that, if disclosed, would reveal vulnerabilities \nin Department of Defense critical infrastructure that, if exploited, would likely re- sult in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to Department of \nDefense operations, property, or facilities, including information regarding the se-\ncuring and safeguarding of explosives, hazardous chemicals, or pipelines, related to critical infrastructure or protected systems owned or operated by or on behalf of \nthe Department of Defense, including vulnerability assessments prepared by or on \nbehalf of the Department of Defense, explosives safety information (including stor- age and handling), and other site-specific information on or relating to installation \nsecurity.   \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e(f).",
      "But the Department\u2019s affidavit is not \u201cfurnished with sufficient information\u201d for the Court \nto decide summary judgment \u201cin a meaningful fashion.\u201d  King, 830 F.2d at 223.  It has provided 4\nalmost no specific information about the 5,000 pages it seeks to withhold for the Court to determine \nwhether they are in fact \u201ccritical infrastructure security information\u201d and qualify for Exemption 3 withholding.  Instead, it supplies a few short paragraphs that rely on generalizations and conclusory \nstatements. \nOne specific shortcoming with the Department\u2019s affidavit worth highlighting is that it does not explain to what \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d the withheld records relate.  To qualify as \u201ccritical \ninfrastructure security information,\u201d the information at issue must, \u201cif disclosed . . . reveal vulner- abilities in Department of Defense critical infrastructure.\u201d  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e(f).  The closest the \nDepartment comes is asserting that the information \u201cindividually or in the aggregate, would enable an adversary to identify capabilities and vulnerabilities in the Department\u2019s approach to artificial \nintelligence development and implementation.\u201d  ECF No. 14-1 at 4.  The Court is left to wonder how \u201cthe Department\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence development and implementation\u201d qual-\nifies as \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d under the statute.  Indeed, an \u201capproach\u201d is not usually considered \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d  In addition, revealing \u201ccapabilities\u201d\u2014rather than \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d\u2014does not ap-\npear to move the needle under the statute.

For example, the affidavit fails to explain how the disclosure of the withheld infor-\nmation would reveal any alleged \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in the critical infrastructure.  See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e(f) (requiring that the information must, \u201cif disclosed . . . reveal vulnerabilities in Depart-\nment of Defense critical infrastructure.\u201d).1  In many cases, such a connection would be self-evident \u2014for example, the statute provides the case of a \u201cvulnerability assessment\u201d of a military base.  Id.  \nNot so here.  On this point too then, the Court has insufficient information to decide whether the Department has \u201cdemonstrate[d] that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed \nexemption.\u201d Larson, 565 F.3d at 862.2",

See ECF No. 14 \nat 3 n.2.  While the Court appreciates the Department\u2019s desire to avoid the administrative burden of reviewing documents for more exemptions, the piecemeal assertion of different exemptions \n\u201cundermines FOIA\u2019s purpose to promote efficient, prompt, and full disclosure of information and",

      ". 1:19-cv-02906 (TNM) MEMORANDUM OPINION The Roman god Janus famously has two faces. One looks backward, toward the past; the other looks forward, toward the future . Mythologists understand his two-faced depiction as complementary, not contradictory.1 It means that every beginning has an ending, every ending a beginning. Like a doorway, Janus looks both ways. So, too, with our Nation\u2019s open government laws",
      ". In general, the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) is backward looking, requiring agencies to disclose historical documents kept by the agency upon request from a private party . Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (\u201cFACA\u201d), certain federal advisory bodies are subject to forward-looking publication requirements, such as giving notice of their meetings, opening them to the public, and proactively making their records publicly available",

Comm\u2019n on Artificial Intelligence (\u201cNSCAI\u201d), 419 F. Supp . 3d 82, 83 (D.D.C. 2019). Given that holding, the Commission now argues that it cannot possibly also be subject to FACA\u2019s forward-looking disclosure obligations . Today, the Court holds that, like Janus, the Commission does indeed have two faces, and that Congress obligated it to comply with FACA as well as FOIA . The Electronic Privacy Information Center (\u201cEPIC\u201d) sued to enforce the Commission\u2019s obligations under both FOIA and FACA. The Court denied the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the FOIA claims. Id . The Government now moves to dismiss EPIC\u2019s FACA claims and its related claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). EPIC moves for summary judgment on these counts . While the Court will dismiss the APA claims for lack of jurisdiction, it will grant summary judgment for EPIC on its FACA claims. I. The Court\u2019s previous opinion provides background on the Commission and EPIC\u2019s suit . See NSCAI, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 83\u201385. A quick refresher is in order",

Like the APA claims, these counts focus on two sets of alleged FACA violations: (1) the Commission\u2019s failure to give notice of its meetings and to open them to the public; and (2) the Commission\u2019s failure to make its records publicly available . Id. \u00b6, 136. EPIC seeks writs of mandamus compelling the Commission to comply with FACA. Id. \u00b6, 139 .

To survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a plaintiff must establish the 5 Court\u2019s jurisdiction over its claims. See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S . 555, 561 (1992). The Court must \u201cassume the truth of all material factual allegations in the complaint and construe the complaint liberally, granting plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged .\u201d Am.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). The Court must view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d Brubaker v. Metro",
      ". Life Ins. Co., 482 F.3d 586, 588 (D.C. Cir. 2007). III. A . The heart of the dispute here is whether the Commission is an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d subject to FACA. But before resolving that, the Court must address some threshold issues . 6 To start, the Court will dismiss EPIC\u2019s APA claims for lack of jurisdiction. \u201cAbsent a waiver of sovereign immunity, the Federal Government is immune from suit.\u201d Loeffler v. Frank, 486 U.S . 549, 554 (1988). The APA waives sovereign immunity when a party seeks relief against an \u201cagency,\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(b)(1). See 5 U.S.C . \u00a7 702; Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 187 & n.13 (D.C. Cir. 2006) . If an entity is not an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1), the waiver does not apply and the Court lacks jurisdiction over any APA claims against that entity. Trudeau, 456 F.3d at 187 & n .13; see FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (\u201cSovereign immunity is jurisdictional in nature.\u201d) . So the Court must first determine whether the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1). See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S",
      ". 83, 98 (1998) (affirming \u201cthe necessity of determining jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits\u201d). Both parties assume the Court\u2019s previous opinion answered this question in the affirmative. See Defs.\u2019 Mem . in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Mem.\u201d) at 14, 16 n.2, ECF No. 28-1; Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Supp. of Mot . for Summ. J. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mem.\u201d) at 28, ECF No. 31-1. But they are mistaken",
      ". The opinion did not hold that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1). It held only that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of FOIA, 5 U.S.C . \u00a7 552(f)(1). The APA and FOIA define \u201cagency\u201d differently. The APA defines an agency as \u201ceach authority of the Government.\u201d 5 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a7 551(1), 701(b)(1). FOIA incorporates this definition but also expands it: \u201c\u2018agency\u2019 as defined in [5 U.S.C . \u00a7 551(1)] includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\u201d Id . \u00a7 552(f)(1). 7 The chronology behind these definitions is key. Before 1974, \u201ceach authority of the Government\u201d was the sole definition of \u201cagency\u201d for both the APA and FOIA. See id . \u00a7 551(1) (stating that the APA\u2019s definition of \u201cagency\u201d applies \u201c[f]or the purpose of this subchapter,\u201d which includes FOIA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552); Energy Research Found",
      ". v. Def. Nuclear Facilities Safety Bd., 917 F.2d 581, 583 (D.C. Cir. 1990). During this period, the D.C . Circuit interpreted the phrase \u201ceach authority of the Government\u201d in \u00a7 551(1) to mean \u201cany administrative unit with substantial independent authority in the exercise of specific functions.\u201d Soucie v. David, 448 F .2d 1067, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1971).3 So for a few years, Soucie supplied the sole test for \u201cagency\u201d status under FOIA. See Energy Research, 917 F .2d at 584. The landscape changed in 1974, when Congress amended FOIA and expanded its definition of \u201cagency.\u201d Pub. L. No. 93-502, \u00a7 3, 88 Stat . 1561, 1564 (1974); Energy Research, 917 F.2d at 583. The 1974 amendment is currently codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1) . The definition of \u201cagency\u201d in \u00a7 552(f)(1) applies only \u201c[f]or purposes of this section,\u201d so it is exclusive to FOIA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)(1) . Indeed, with the language in \u00a7 552(f)(1), \u201cCongress sought to encompass entities that might have eluded the APA\u2019s definition in \u00a7 551(1).\u201d Energy Research, 917 F.2d at 583 . The upshot is that if an entity fits one of the categories in \u00a7 552(f)(1)\u2014such as \u201cestablishment in the executive branch\u201d\u2014it will not 3 Though Soucie cited only \u00a7 551(1), see",
      "448 F",
      ".2d at 1073 n.13, its interpretation applies equally to the identical phrase in \u00a7 701(b)(1). See Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d 607, 616 & n .54 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (citing Soucie, among other authorities, in concluding that the Micronesian Claims Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1)); Flaherty v . Ross, 373 F. Supp. 3d 97, 104 & n.2 (D.D.C. 2019); see also Pl.\u2019s Reply at 6 & n.1, ECF No . 35. This accords with the canon that a phrase\u2014here, \u201cauthority of the Government\u201d\u2014\u201cis presumed to bear the same meaning throughout a text.\u201d Antonin Scalia & Bryan A . Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 170 (2012) . Thus, under Soucie, the touchstone of \u201cagency\u201d status under \u00a7 701(b)(1) is the exercise of \u201csubstantial independent authority",
      ".\u201d 8 necessarily qualify as an \u201cauthority of the Government\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) and \u00a7 701(b)(1). See id. at 583\u201384 . Congress thus allowed for something to be an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) or \u00a7 701(b)(1) . In other words, because of the 1974 amendment, all APA agencies are FOIA agencies, but not vice-versa. The Commission is precisely this sort of FOIA-only agency . The Court\u2019s previous opinion got us halfway to this conclusion, since it held that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) . Any impression conveyed that the Commission is also an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) and \u00a7 701(b)(1) was dicta. Energy Research was the template for the Court\u2019s opinion . It held that the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board was an \u201cagency\u201d under FOIA because the Board\u2019s organic statute called it an \u201cestablishment in the executive branch,\u201d one of the categories in \u00a7 552(f)(1). Id . at 582\u201383. And there was \u201cnothing to indicate that Congress intended to excuse the Board from complying with FOIA.\u201d Id. at 583. That was the end of the matter . For entities that fit into one of the \u00a7 552(f)(1) categories, Soucie\u2019s functional test determines agency status only if the entity is in the White House. See id. at 584 (citing Crooker v",
      ". Office of the Pardon Attorney, 614 F.2d 825, 828 (2d Cir. 1980)) . The Board was not in the White House, so the functional test was irrelevant to its status as an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1). See id. at 582\u201384 . Then in dicta, the court opined that the Board exercised \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d and thus was also a FOIA \u201cagency\u201d under Soucie\u2019s functional test. Id. at 584\u201385 . This Court\u2019s previous opinion followed Energy Research\u2019s analytical steps. As with the Board, Congress made the Commission an \u201cestablishment in the executive branch,\u201d one of the categories in \u00a7 552(f)(1) . NSCAI, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 86. Also like the Board, nothing in the Commission\u2019s organic statute suggested that Congress intended to excuse it from FOIA . Indeed, 9 the opposite was true, since the 2019 NDAA excused a different entity from FOIA but did exempt the Commission. Id. at 86\u201387 . And Soucie did not apply because\u2014again like the Board\u2014the Commission is not in the White House. Id. at 89 . \u201cThe text of \u00a7 552(f)(1)\u201d was therefore \u201cdispositive\u201d of the Commission\u2019s status as a FOIA \u201cagency.\u201d Id",
      ". Then, relying on the dicta from Energy Research, the Court suggested in passing that the Commission exercises \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d and thus could meet Soucie\u2019s functional test, too. Id. at 89\u201390 . Still, the Court made clear that this functional test was \u201cnot relevant.\u201d Id. at 90. So, just as in Energy Research, its application of the functional test was dicta . And because this discussion relied on the dicta from Energy Research, this was dicta upon dicta. The Government is thus imprecise when it asserts as the \u201claw of the case\u201d that the Commission is an \u201cagency.\u201d Defs .\u2019 Mem. at 16 n.2. This assertion\u2014without reference to specific statutory provisions\u2014is only half correct. Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u201cthe same issue presented a second time in the same case should lead to the same result .\u201d LaShawn A. v. Berry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Dicta is not part of the law of the case . Nat\u2019l Souvenir Ctr., Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., 728 F.2d 503, 511 (D.C. Cir. 1984) . By these standards, the law of this case is that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1), because that was the dispositive point in the Court\u2019s first opinion . But any dicta\u2014 including that the Commission also met Soucie\u2019s functional test\u2014is not the law of this case",
      ". Unlike last time, it is now necessary to decide whether the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1)\u2014as noted, the Court\u2019s jurisdiction over EPIC\u2019s APA claims turns on this . The Government implicitly concedes that the Commission is an agency under \u00a7 701(b)(1), since it mistakenly reads the Court\u2019s previous opinion as having held this. See Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 14, 16 10 n .2. But the Court cannot simply adopt this concession. \u201c[S]ubject-matter jurisdiction, because it involves a court\u2019s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived.\u201d United States v. Cotton, 535 U .S. 625, 630 (2002). The Court thus has \u201can independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists.\u201d Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S . 500, 514 (2006). And upon closer examination, the Court finds that the Commission is not an agency under \u00a7 551(1) or \u00a7 701(b)(1). The D.C",
      ". Circuit\u2019s cases highlight two factors that are central to whether an entity wields \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d: investigative power and authority to make final and binding decisions. Consider first Soucie . The Circuit held that the Office of Science and Technology (\u201cOST\u201d) was an agency because, beyond advising the President, it had the \u201cindependent function of evaluating federal programs.\u201d 448 F.2d at 1075 . Critically, in carrying out this \u201cindependent function,\u201d the OST wielded \u201cportions\u201d of Congress\u2019s own \u201cinvestigatory power.\u201d Id. at 1075 & n.27 . In describing this power, the court cited McGrain v. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135 (1927), which upheld the Senate\u2019s authority to compel testimony. Id. at 180 .

But because the Commission is not an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 701(b)(1), the Court must dismiss EPIC\u2019s APA claims (Counts II, III, and V) for lack of jurisdiction.

DOJ, 491 U.S . 440, 445\u201346 (1989). It found that these bodies are \u201ca useful and beneficial means of furnishing expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the Federal Government.\u201d 5 U.S.C. app . 2 \u00a7 2(a). And it saw a need to keep the public \u201cinformed\u201d about their \u201cactivities.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2(b)(5). To that end, FACA calls for open meetings . A committee\u2019s meetings \u201cshall be open to the public.\u201d Id. \u00a7 10(a)(1). \u201c[T]imely notice\u201d of these meetings \u201cshall be published in the Federal Register.\u201d Id . \u00a7 10(a)(2).

Unlike FOIA, this provision looks forward. It requires committees to take affirmative steps to make their records are public, even absent a request. FACA\u2019s definition of \u201cadvisory committee\u201d has four parts . First, it includes \u201cany committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3(2)",

      ". Fourth, the definition excludes \u201cany committee that is composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Government.\u201d Id. The Court agrees with EPIC that the Commission meets this definition . Start with the text of the 2019 NDAA, the Commission\u2019s organic statute. Congress established a \u201cCommission.\u201d Pub. L. No. 115-232, \u00a7 1051(a)(1) . Its mandate is to \u201cconsider the 16 methods and means necessary to advance the development of artificial intelligence . . . to comprehensively address the national security and defense needs of the United States.\u201d Id . \u00a7 1051(b)(1).

L. No. 116-92, \u00a7 1735(c). These words fit the definition of \u201cadvisory committee\u201d like a glove . From a purely commonsense standpoint, is the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence an \u201cadvisory\u201d commission? Of course it is. Congress created a \u201ccommission.\u201d 5 U.S.C. app . 2 \u00a7 3(2). It is \u201cestablished by statute\u201d and \u201cutilized by the President.\u201d Id .

      ". More, Congress noticeably declined to exempt the Commission from FACA, even though it carved out FACA exemptions elsewhere in the same law .

The Court likewise found the lack of an exemption significant in concluding that the Commission is subject to FOIA. See NSCAI, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 86\u201387 . The 2019 NDAA excuses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission from FOIA, see Pub. L. No. 115-232, \u00a7 1652(m)(2), but does not excuse the AI Commission from FOIA .

But here, that is wrong, since Congress elsewhere carved out exemptions . \u201cWhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d Russello v . United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (cleaned up). The Government also points to one example\u2014from a different law\u2014in which Congress made clear that FACA applies. Defs",

Based on this example, the Government contends that \u201cit is at least as telling that Congress also did not explicitly make the Commission an advisory committee.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply at 17. Not quite . Congress formed the Commission using language that tracks FACA\u2019s definition of \u201cadvisory committee.\u201d That was enough to \u201cmake\u201d the Commission an advisory committee . It is a fair point that Congress did not declare in so many words that \u201cFACA shall apply\u201d to the Commission. But a weak one . The one example the Government cites was in the Pandemic Act, not the 2019 NDAA. The 2019 NDAA itself contains no examples of Congress saying that \u201cFACA shall apply .\u201d It contains only examples of Congress saying that \u201cFACA shall not apply.\u201d Yet the NDAA does not use this language for the Commission. This reinforces the conclusion that Congress made the Commission an \u201cadvisory committee .\u201d See Russello, 464 U.S. at 22\u201323. 18 EPIC also points out that Congress passed on a second chance to exempt the Commission from FACA. Pl.\u2019s Mem. at 19\u201320 . The 2020 NDAA extended the life of the Commission and gave it some new reporting deadlines, but it said nothing about FACA. See Pub. L. No. 116-92, \u00a7 1735 . And once again, Congress exempted a different entity from FACA in the same law. See id. \u00a7 6433(a) (\u201cThe Federal Advisory Committee Act . .",
      ". shall not apply to the [advisory board for the National Reconnaissance Office].\u201d) . The Government responds that \u201cthere was no need to include a FACA exemption\u201d in the 2020 NDAA because (1) Congress passed it after this Court ruled that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d; (2) Congress is presumed to know extant law; and (3) extant law holds that an \u201cagency\u201d cannot also be an \u201cadvisory committee",
      ".\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply at 18",
      ". But even assuming Congress would note an interim ruling by a district court in ongoing litigation, this third premise is wrong\u2014under extant law, at least some agencies can be advisory committees, and the Commission is case in point. See infra Section III .B.1. In short, the language that Congress used to create the Commission matches FACA\u2019s definition of \u201cadvisory committee .\u201d And Congress twice declined to excuse the Commission from FACA, even though both laws carved out FACA exemptions for other entities. The Court thus concludes that the Commission is an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d subject to FACA . The Government resists this conclusion on two overarching grounds. 1. Its primary contention is that the Commission, as an \u201cagency,\u201d cannot also be an \u201cadvisory committee.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 8 . This argument fails because the Government\u2019s authorities do not support the categorical principle that all agencies cannot be advisory committees. At most they suggest that a \u00a7 551(1) agency cannot be an advisory committee . 19 That is significant, because the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1). See supra Section III.A . The Government cites no case holding that this sort of agency cannot be an advisory committee. To the contrary, Congress has devised a statutory scheme that allows \u00a7 552(f)(1) agencies like the Commission to be advisory committees subject to FACA . The Government\u2019s notion of a categorical principle stems mainly from a series of decisions in this District. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 14; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 9 n.2. The first was Gates v",
      ". Schlesinger, 366 F. Supp. 797 (D.D.C. 1973), which stated that \u201can advisory committee is not an \u2018agency.\u2019\u201d Id. at 799 . Gates\u2019s first rationale for this conclusion was that FACA \u201cutilizes the definition of agency contained in . . . 5 U.S.C . \u00a7 551(1)\u201d and \u201ccontains a separate and distinct definition of an \u2018advisory committee.\u2019\u201d Id. at 798\u201399 . It is true that FACA defines \u201cadvisory committee\u201d in \u00a7 3(2) and separately defines \u201cagency\u201d in \u00a7 3(3). 5 U.S.C. app . 2 \u00a7 3(2), (3). But nothing in section 3 excludes the possibility that an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d can fit within the definition of \u201cagency\u201d and vice-versa . And certainly, agencies are commonly \u201cestablished by statute,\u201d \u201cutilized by the President,\u201d or even \u201cutilized\u201d by other agencies \u201cin the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations.\u201d Id . \u00a7 3(2) (definition of \u201cadvisory committee\u201d). Indeed, many statutes list separate definitions that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Pl.\u2019s Reply at 11, ECF No. 35. Take 5 U",
      ".S.C. \u00a7 552a, which defines \u201cindividual\u201d as \u201ca citizen of the United States\u201d and separately defines \u201cFederal personnel\u201d as \u201cofficers and employees of the Government.\u201d 5 U.S.C . \u00a7 552a(a)(2), (a)(13). A \u201ccitizen of the United States\u201d and \u201cofficers and employees of the Government\u201d are of course not mutually exclusive concepts, even though they appear in separate definitions . Likewise here. 20 In any event, Gates is distinguishable because it says nothing about entities\u2014like the Commission\u2014that are agencies under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1). And it could not have . Gates was decided in 1973, before Congress added \u00a7 552(f)(1) in 1974. FACA defines \u201cagency\u201d to have \u201cthe same meaning as in section 551(1) of title 5 .\u201d 5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 3(3). And FACA does not mention \u00a7 552(f)(1) . So even if Gates is right that FACA\u2019s definitions of \u201cadvisory committee\u201d and \u201cagency\u201d are mutually exclusive, this just means an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 551(1) cannot be an advisory committee . Nothing in FACA or Gates prevents a \u00a7 552(f)(1) agency from also being an advisory committee . This point\u2014that the Commission is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1)\u2014is key for another reason",

Under Soucie, the touchstone of agency status under \u00a7 551(1) is \u201csubstantial independent authority .\u201d Gates, Washington Research Project, and the DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d) suggest that entities wielding \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d cannot be \u201cadvisory\u201d committees . But even if true, this point is irrelevant here, since the Commission does not wield \u201csubstantial independent authority.\u201d See supra Section III.A . Specifically, Gates cites Soucie\u2019s holding that \u00a7 551(1) \u201cconfers agency status on any administrative unit with substantial independent authority.\u201d 366 F. Supp. at 799 . The committee in Gates was \u201cadvisory only\u201d and \u201cpossesse[d] no \u2018substantial independent authority.\u2019\u201d Id . This reasoning suggests that the concept of \u201cadvisory\u201d in FACA and the concept of \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d in \u00a7 551(1) are mutually exclusive. The D.C . Circuit echoed this suggestion when, applying Soucie\u2019s \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d test, it opined that \u201cIRGs are advisory committees . . . and are not agencies [under \u00a7 551(1)].\u201d Wash",
      ". Research Project, 504 F.2d at 246\u201347",
      ". This decision, like 21 Gates, came before Congress enacted \u00a7 552(f)(1), so it could not have been drawing any conclusions about entities that are agencies under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1) .7 To be sure, the OLC has opined that entities wielding substantial independent authority\u2014 i.e., \u00a7 551(1) agencies\u2014cannot be advisory committees . \u201cFACA,\u201d in its view, \u201cis predicated on the assumption . . . that advisory committees give advice and recommendations, whereas agencies are operating arms of government characterized by \u2018substantial independent authority in the exercise of specific functions .\u2019\u201d Disclosure of Advisory Comm. Deliberative Materials, 12 Op. O.L.C. 73, 81 (1988). This \u201cstatutory distinction,\u201d it concludes, signifies that \u201cadvisory committees are not agencies .\u201d Id. It is not entirely clear that \u201cadvisory\u201d and \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d are mutually exclusive concepts . But the Court need not resolve this, because the Commission does not wield \u201csubstantial independent authority\u201d and is not an agency under \u00a7 551(1). See supra Section III.A . The exclusive focus on \u00a7 551(1) in Gates, Washington Research Project, and the OLC opinion does not speak to whether an entity like the Commission\u2014an \u201cagency\u201d only under \u00a7 552(f)(1)\u2014can be an advisory",
      "committee",
      ". After Gates, the next decision to conclude that \u201can advisory committee cannot have a \u2018double identity\u2019 as an agency\u201d was Wolfe v. Weinberger, 403 F. Supp. 238, 242 (D.D.C . 1975). 7 Though Washington Research Project noted that \u201cIRGs are advisory committees,\u201d 504 F .2d at 246, it also stated that \u201c[w]hether the IRG is subject to the disclosure requirements of [FACA] is not a question before this court,\u201d id. at 249 n.15 . So it is not even clear that the court was distinguishing \u00a7 551(1) agencies from FACA advisory committees. See id. at 248 & n.15. The Government also cites Forsham v . Califano, 587 F.2d 1128 (D.C. Cir. 1978), for the proposition that agencies cannot be advisory committees. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 21, 23; Defs .\u2019 Reply at 12. But Forsham merely quoted the language from Washington Research Project that \u201cthe IRGs are advisory committees . . . and are not agencies,\u201d 587 F .2d at 1135, and it nowhere mentions \u00a7 552(f)(1). So it provides no more support for the Government\u2019s position than Washington Research Project itself . 22 It gave another rationale: \u201cthe definition of \u2018advisory committee\u2019 in [FACA] specifically excludes \u2018any committee which is composed wholly of fulltime officers or employees of the Federal Government,\u2019 thus providing further evidence that",
      "\u2018agency\u2019 and \u2018advisory committee\u2019 were not meant by Congress to be congruent concepts .\u201d Id. (quoting 5 U.S.C. app. 2 \u00a7 3(2) (1972)) . The implicit assumption in this rationale is that all agencies are \u201ccomposed wholly of fulltime officers or employees of the Federal Government.\u201d But Wolfe gave no basis for that assumption, nor does the Government provide any. See Defs .\u2019 Reply at 12\u201313. The better approach is simply to ask if an entity consists wholly of full-time federal employees. If so, it is not an advisory committee, no matter if it is an agency. More, Wolfe is also outdated . At the time, the exclusion in \u00a7 3(2) was only for groups \u201ccomposed wholly of full-time officers or employees.\u201d Federal Advisory Committee Act, Pub. L. No . 92-463, \u00a7 3(2), 86 Stat. 770, 770 (1972) . But now, the exclusion is for groups \u201ccomposed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Government.\u201d 5 U.S.C. app . 2 \u00a7 3(2) (2018) (emphasis added); see Federal Advisory Committee Act Amendments of 1997, Pub. L. 105-153, \u00a7 2(a), 111 Stat",
      ". 2689, 2689. The Government here argues that the Commission\u2014an agency\u2014has only \u201cpermanent part-time\u201d employees. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 20 . So, by the Government\u2019s own logic, Wolfe\u2019s assumption no longer holds\u2014at least some agencies do not consist of full-time employees . And the Government does not try to defend a modern version of Wolfe\u2019s assumption: that all agencies consist wholly of full-time or permanent part-time employees. See id. at 21\u201322; Defs .\u2019 Reply at 9, 12\u201313. So there is no basis to conclude that Congress obliquely barred dual status through FACA\u2019s employee-based exclusion . 23 And in any event, Congress made the Commission\u2019s employees \u201ctemporary,\u201d not \u201cpermanent,\u201d see infra Section III.B.2, which shows that FACA\u2019s employee-based exclusion does not encompass all agencies . In sum, Wolfe does not foreclose the possibility that something can\u2014all at once\u2014be an \u201cagency\u201d solely under \u00a7 552(f)(1), consist of \u201ctemporary\u201d federal employees, and be an \u201cadvisory committee .\u201d Three more recent cases likewise conclude that an advisory committee cannot have a \u201cdouble identity\u201d as an agency, but they do not expand on the reasoning from Gates or Wolfe. See Drone Advisory Comm., 369 F. Supp",
      ". 3d at 41; Freedom Watch, Inc. v. Obama, 807 F. Supp. 2d 28, 33 (D.D.C. 2011); Heartwood, Inc. v. U.S . Forest Serv., 431 F. Supp. 2d 28, 36 (D.D.C. 2006)",
      ". None of these decisions mentions \u00a7 552(f)(1) much less considers whether something that is an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1) can be an \u201cadvisory committee .\u201d So they support the Government\u2019s position no more than Gates or Wolfe. The Government next highlights complications that could arise if FOIA and FACA apply to the same entity. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 14\u201316 . It asserts that FOIA and FACA impose \u201cindependent, mutually exclusive [disclosure] obligations.\u201d Id. at 14 . The Government invites the Court to accept this premise and work backward from there to conclude that Congress could not have meant what it said in the 2019 NDAA when it made the Commission subject to both statutes. The Court declines this invitation . Even though FOIA and FACA have different disclosure requirements, the Court sees no conflict between those requirements as the Government has framed them. And even if there were a conflict, that would not be a license to ignore what Congress said . Because Congress, through the 2019 NDAA, made the Commission 24 subject to both FOIA and FACA, it will be incumbent on the parties and the Court to resolve any difficulties in the application of these statutes if that time comes .8 The Government claims it is a problem that FOIA and FACA \u201capply to different documents.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 15. There are two arguments baked in here",
      ". First, the Government suggests that records of advisory committees cannot, by definition, be records of agencies. Id.; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 7\u20138, 8 n.1. It cites Judicial Watch, Inc. v . Department of Energy, 412 F.3d 125 (D.C. Cir . 2005), which dealt with the records of employees that the Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) had detailed to the National Energy Policy Development Group (\u201cNEPDG\u201d). Id. at 132 . The Government quotes the court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe records those employees created or obtained while on detail were those of the NEPDG, not those of the DOE, and hence not \u2018agency records\u2019 within the meaning of FOIA.\u201d Id . It takes this to mean that the NEPDG\u2019s records were not agency records because the NEPDG was an advisory committee. See Defs.\u2019 Reply at 8 n.1 . The court could not have meant this, though, because it had concluded a month earlier that \u201cthe NEPDG was not a FACA advisory committee.\u201d In re Cheney, 406 F.3d 723, 730 (D.C . Cir. 2005). The holding of Judicial Watch was instead much more straightforward: the NEPDG\u2019s records were not agency records because the NEPDG was not an \u201cagency.\u201d 412 F .3d at 129, 132. It did not come close to holding that advisory committee records cannot, by definition, be agency records. Judicial Watch thus does not bear the weight that the Government assigns to it. See Defs",
      ".\u2019 Reply at 7\u20138. 8 Indeed, EPIC has potentially smoothed the road already",
      ". Its FOIA request sought \u201c[a]ll records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, studies, agenda[s], or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by\u201d the Commission, a direct quotation from section 10(b) of FACA . Pl.\u2019s Mot. Exs. at 21. EPIC agrees that its FOIA request \u201cexactly track[s] the language of FACA \u00a7 10(b)\u201d\u2014i.e",
      "., that its FOIA request is meant to be coterminous with FACA\u2019s parameters. Pl.\u2019s Mem. at 24; Pl.\u2019s Reply at 9 . 25 Second, on this subject of records, the Government invokes the so-called \u201cstaff work\u201d exception to FACA. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 15 . Under this exception, the Government says, \u201c\u2018staff work\u2019 or other documents not directly considered by the committee members are not subject to FACA\u2019s open records requirement.\u201d Id. FOIA, by contrast, \u201ccontains no equivalent exception.\u201d Id . Assuming without deciding that this \u201cstaff work\u201d exception exists,9 the Court sees no conflict . Under the Government\u2019s framing of the exception, if FACA and FOIA apply to the same entity, FACA requires it to disclose certain records, and FOIA requires it to disclose certain additional records . But this would just mean an entity that is both an advisory committee and an agency has greater transparency obligations\u2014for \u201cstaff work\u201d\u2014than an entity that is only an advisory committee. There is nothing problematic about this. See Pl.\u2019s Mem . at 25 (\u201cCongress may add to the transparency requirements of a federal entity as it desires; there is no provision or rule that limits disclosure obligations to just the FOIA or just the FACA for a particular entity.\u201d) . The Government\u2019s next argument revolves around FOIA\u2019s Exemption 5, which exempts from disclosure \u201cinter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation",
      "with the agency",
      ".\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5); see Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 15\u201316 . It posits that Exemption 5 reveals the \u201cclearest inconsistency in deeming the same entity an advisory committee and an agency.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply at 8 . The problem, according to the Government, is that FACA generally requires disclosure of records, yet Exemption 5 would shield a portion of these records from public view, which would undermine FACA\u2019s \u201cpurpose.\u201d Id . at 8\u20139. Gates, Wolfe, and the 1988 OLC opinion echo this concern. See Gates, 366 F. Supp. at 799\u2013800; Wolfe, 403 F. Supp . at 242\u201343; Disclosure of 9 EPIC suggests that it does not. See Pl.\u2019s Mem. at 24 & n.1. 26 Advisory Committee Deliberative Materials, 12 Op. O.L.C . at 77. The Court is unconvinced that a single FOIA exemption prevents Congress from imposing FOIA and FACA on the same body . To begin with, even accepting that FACA\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d is relevant, Gates and Wolfe are once again distinguishable. Those cases dealt with advisory committees already subject to FACA, and the question was whether they were also agencies . If the answer were yes, both decisions reasoned, that would allow the advisory committee to exploit Exemption 5, which would undermine FACA\u2019s purpose. See Gates, 366 F. Supp",
      ". at 799\u2013800; Wolfe, 403 F. Supp. at 242\u201343. Here, we have the reverse situation . The starting point is that the Commission is an agency subject to FOIA, see NSCAI, 419 F. Supp",
      ". 3d at 86, so on the Government\u2019s view, Exemption 5 is already in play, see Defs.\u2019 Reply at 8 . The Government now tries to argue that because Exemption 5 may shield some records that FACA would otherwise bring to the light of day\u2014which would work to the Government\u2019s advantage\u2014the Court should excuse the Commission from FACA entirely . But permitting the Government this double advantage would hardly serve FACA\u2019s goal of transparency. More, Exemption 5 fails to present a conflict . Under the Government\u2019s framing, Exemption 5 would permit the Commission to withhold certain records that are otherwise subject to disclosure under FACA. Id . Assuming for sake of argument that this framing is correct, it represents a way to reconcile FOIA and FACA: working together, they favor withholding certain documents. Cf. Pl .\u2019s Reply at 8 (\u201cThe fact that the FOIA and the FACA generally treat deliberative records differently does not make the statutes irreconcilable; it simply means that a court must reconcile [their] disclosure provisions if and when that court confronts an assertion of Exemption 5 by a dual FOIA-FACA entity .\u201d (citation omitted)). 27 The lack of a conflict is particularly apparent here because FACA\u2019s disclosure provision incorporates FOIA\u2019s exemptions. See 5 U.S.C. app",

Johnson, 488 F .3d 1002, 1003 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\u201cFACA incorporates the FOIA exemptions.\u201d) . So, as EPIC puts it, \u201cCongress has already done much of the work to reconcile FACA \u00a7 10(b) and the FOIA exemptions.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 7",
      ". Finally, the Government\u2019s arguments about Exemption 5 reduce to arguments about purpose, see Defs.\u2019 Reply at 8\u20139, but that is the wrong way to go about statutory interpretation . Gone are the days when arguments about a statute\u2019s purposes trump clear statutory text. See, e.g., Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.S. 41, 55 n .4 (2012) (\u201c[E]ven the most formidable argument concerning the statute\u2019s purposes could not overcome the clarity we find in the statute\u2019s text.\u201d) . Here, the \u201cclarity\u201d in the text is that the 2019 NDAA made the Commission both an agency subject to FOIA, see NSCAI, 419 F. Supp",
      ". 3d at 86, and an advisory committee subject to FACA, see supra Section III.B . The Court declines to work backward from an argument about FACA\u2019s purpose to conclude that Congress could not have meant what it said in the 2019 NDAA . The Government makes two final attempts to show a conflict between FOIA and FACA, but they are unavailing. It asserts that FOIA\u2019s disclosure obligations\u2014unlike FACA\u2019s disclosure obligations\u2014are \u201climited in time.\u201d Defs .\u2019 Mem. at 16. FOIA requires an agency to produce only records the agency controls at the time of the request, while FACA lacks this limitation. Id . The Government next states that FOIA and FACA \u201ccreate different obligations with regard to the creation of documents.\u201d Id. FOIA does not require agencies to chronicle its activities, while FACA does. Id . 28 These different obligations are complementary, not conflicting . If the Government is correct, an entity subject to FOIA and FACA would need to look backward, producing records in response to requests, and forward, chronicling its activities and continually supplementing its records . This Janus-like status may be unusual, but it is not impossible. And even if there is some tension or conflict between FOIA and FACA, the Government has not offered a persuasive reason why that should matter",
      ". It claims that complying with both \u201cwould impose greater burdens . . . than is contemplated by either statute alone [and would] wast[e] government resources on complying with redundant requirements.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Reply at 13 . This, the Government stresses, \u201cwould produce an absurd and unjust result which Congress could not have intended.\u201d Id. (quoting Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 429 (1998)) . An appeal to absurdity faces \u201ca high bar,\u201d and the Government has not come close to clearing it here. Stovic v. R.R. Ret. Bd., 826 F.3d 500, 505 (D.C",
      ". Cir. 2016). The Government must deal with burdensome\u2014and indeed conflicting\u2014requirements in other areas of law, perhaps most notably in the context of criminal pretrial disclosures . There, the Government faces at least three different and divergent discovery schemes. See, e.g., Cara Spencer, Prosecutorial Disclosure Timing: Does Brady Trump the Jencks Act?, 26 Geo. J . Legal Ethics 997, 997 (2013). Yet the Government has proven up to the task.10 The Court expects the same here . For all these reasons, no rule prevented Congress from making the Commission what it is: an \u201cagency\u201d under \u00a7 552(f)(1) but not \u00a7 551(1), and an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d under FACA . 10 See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 9-5.000\u2014Issues Related to Discovery Trials, and Other Proceedings, https://www.justice .gov/jm/jm-9-5000-issues-related-trials-and-other-court- proceedings (last visited May 29, 2020) (clarifying how to navigate discovery). 29 2 .

See Defs.\u2019 Reply at 15 n.5 . The Government also tries to rely on a \u201ccommon law\u201d meaning of \u201cpermanent employee,\u201d but this too fails . It says that under the common law, \u201ca permanent employee is one who is guaranteed a position with an employer so long as the employee\u2019s work is satisfactory and the employer continues to engage in work that requires the employee\u2019s job functions.\u201d Id . at 16 (citing Hodge v. Evans Fin. Corp., 707 F.2d 1566, 1568 (D.C. Cir. 1983)) . Hodge specifically contrasted this concept of \u201cpermanent employment\u201d with employment \u201cscheduled to terminate on a specific date.\u201d See 707 F.2d at 1568",
      ". The Commission is scheduled to terminate on a specific date, see 2020 NDAA, Pub. L. No . 116-92, \u00a7 1735(a), so its members do not meet the Government\u2019s \u201ccommon law\u201d definition of \u201cpermanent employee .\u201d In sum, the Government offers no convincing reason to reject the natural reading of the 2019 NDAA\u2014that the Commission\u2019s members, as employees of a \u201ctemporary\u201d federal organization, are \u201ctemporary\u201d federal employees . So the Commission does not fall into FACA\u2019s exclusion for committees \u201ccomposed wholly of . . . permanent part-time . . . employees.\u201d 5 U.S.C. app . 2 \u00a7 3(2). 32 A second, independent reason why the Commission does not fall within this exclusion is that its members are not \u201cpart-time\u201d federal employees. Instead, they are \u201cintermittent\u201d employees",
      ". EPIC points to a regulation stating that \u201c[a]n intermittent work schedule is appropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty cannot be regularly scheduled in advance.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem . at 18 (quoting 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 340.403(a)) . This regulation explicitly distinguishes \u201cintermittent\u201d status from \u201cpart-time\u201d status, as it says that \u201c[w]hen an agency is able to schedule work in advance on a regular basis, it has an obligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part-time or full-time to ensure proper service credit .\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 340.403(a). The Court agrees with EPIC that \u201cintermittent\u201d accurately describes the employment status of the Commission\u2019s members . All the members have day jobs, the Commission \u201cmeets in plenary every other month,\u201d and \u201ceach working group meets monthly.\u201d See Compl. \u00b6, 48 (cleaned up); Answer \u00b6, 48, ECF No . 29. For example, the Commission met on March 11, May 20, and July 11 of 2019. See Compl. \u00b6, 67, 69; Answer \u00b6, 67, 69 . This limited and irregular work schedule fits the bill as \u201csporadic and unpredictable.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 340.403(a). The Government does not dispute that \u00a7 340",
      ".403 is relevant to the meaning of \u201cpart- time\u201d versus \u201cintermittent.\u201d Indeed, it provides no affirmative argument for why the Commission\u2019s members are \u201cpart-time.\u201d See Defs.\u2019 Mem . at 21\u201322; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 16\u201317.11 11 EPIC claims the Government\u2019s Answer conceded that \u201cthe members of the AI Commission are employed on an \u2018intermittent\u2019 basis.\u201d Compl .

The Court need not resolve this, as it does not rely on this aspect of EPIC\u2019s argument in concluding that the Commission\u2019s members are \u201cintermittent\u201d employees . The Court also does not rely on EPIC\u2019s assertion\u2014 supported by a declaration attached to its reply brief\u2014that the Commission\u2019s chief of staff stated that \u201cthe members of the Commission were employed in \u2018excepted service appointments on an intermittent basis .\u2019\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply at 15; see Davisson Decl. , ECF No. 35-1. 33 One final point: EPIC\u2019s position finds support in Association of American Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v",
      ". Clinton (\u201cAAPS\u201d), 997 F.2d 898 (D.C. Cir. 1993). AAPS considered the status the President\u2019s Task Force on National Health Care Reform and its working group. Id. at 900 . The court remanded for further proceedings on the status of the working group. Id. It was composed in part of \u201c40 \u2018special government employees\u2019 hired by . . . agencies and the Executive Office of the President for a limited duration.\u201d Id. at 901. The court expressed skepticism that the working group\u2014so composed\u2014fell within FACA\u2019s exclusion . \u201cFACA would be rather easy to avoid if an agency could simply appoint 10 private citizens as special government employees for two days, and then have the committee receive the section 3(2) exemption as a body composed of full-time government employees .\u201d Id. at 915. Similar logic applies here. FACA \u201cwould be rather easy to avoid\u201d if the Government is right that private-citizen members of short-term advisory groups are always \u201cpermanent part- time\u201d employees of the Federal Government . Indeed, AAPS generalized that \u201ca formal group of a limited number of private citizens who are brought together to give publicized advice as a group . . . would seem covered by [FACA].\u201d Id . The Commission fits this model. C. Because the Commission is an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d that must comply with FACA\u2019s requirements, EPIC\u2019s entitlement to mandamus relief is straightforward",
      ". The party seeking mandamus has the burden of showing \u201c(1) a clear and indisputable right to relief, (2) that the government agency or official is violating a clear duty to act, and (3) that no adequate alternative",
      "remedy exists",

Hosp. Ass\u2019n, 812 F",
      ".3d at 189. Given the Commission\u2019s clear duty to comply with FACA, the Court 34 EPIC has shown all three. Since relief under the APA is unavailable, see supra Section III.A, \u201cno adequate alternative remedy exists .\u201d And the Government\u2019s sole argument for why EPIC has not established \u201ca clear and indisputable right to relief\u201d or \u201ca clear duty to act\u201d is that the Commission is not an \u201cadvisory committee\u201d under FACA . Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 20\u201324.13 This, of course, is the argument that the Court has rejected. See supra Section III.B . The Government\u2019s only remaining argument against mandamus is that EPIC did not \u201cadequately plead[]\u201d claims under the mandamus statute. Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 18\u201319 . \u201c[I]t is impossible to know,\u201d the Government complains, \u201cwhat counts [EPIC] intended to pursue under\u201d this statute \u201cor the specific allegations that would support claims under [it].\u201d Id. The Court disagrees . EPIC styles its Complaint as one \u201cfor Injunctive, Mandamus, and Declaratory Relief.\u201d Compl. at 1. It cites the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C . \u00a7 1361, in the Complaint\u2019s first paragraph and in its jurisdictional statement. Id. \u00b6, 7 . Then, in Count I, it claims that the Commission\u2019s \u201cfailure to timely notice and open [its] meetings violates 5 U.S.C. app",
      ". 2 \u00a7\u00a7 10(a)(1) and (a)(2) finds \u201ccompelling equitable grounds\u201d for mandamus relief . Indeed, the Government makes no argument for why, if the Commission is subject to FACA, there would not be \u201ccompelling equitable grounds\u201d for relief . Other than an argument that EPIC has an adequate alternative remedy in the APA and an argument that EPIC did not adequately plead mandamus claims, which the Court addresses infra, the Government\u2019s arguments against mandamus focus exclusively on its belief that the Commission is just not subject to FACA in the first place . See Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 18\u201324; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 18\u201320, 18 n.6. 13 For the first element of mandamus, the Government invokes the doctrine of \u201cjudicial estoppel",
      ".\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 22\u201324. This doctrine \u201cgenerally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\u201d Pegram v . Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 227 n.8 (2000)",
      ". The Government contends that this doctrine bars mandamus relief because EPIC \u201cprevailed on its earlier position that the Commission is an agency subject to FOIA\u201d and \u201can entity cannot be both an agency and an advisory committee.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mem . at 23. So the Government\u2019s invocation of \u201cjudicial estoppel\u201d just boils down to its argument that the Commission is not an advisory committee . 35 and constitutes a failure to perform duties owed to EPIC within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.\u201d Id. . Count IV likewise asserts that the Commission\u2019s \u201cfailure to make [its] records available for inspection and copying is a violation of 5 U.S.C. app . 2 \u00a7 10(b) and constitutes a failure to perform a duty owed to EPIC within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.\u201d Id. . Both counts seek \u201ca writ of mandamus\u201d compelling the Commission and its officers to comply with FACA. Id. \u00b6, 139 . These counts make clear that EPIC seeks mandamus relief based on the Commission\u2019s refusal to comply with FACA. And for the reasons explained, EPIC is correct that the Commission is subject to FACA . EPIC is thus entitled to writs of mandamus compelling the Commission and its officers to provide timely notice of its meetings, to open them to the public, and to make its records available for public inspection and copying.

The Court independently has jurisdiction here under the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C . \u00a7 1361, and EPIC has a judicially remediable right to have the Commission comply with its duties under FACA. See Wash. Legal Found., 89 F.3d at 901\u201302; supra Section III.B .

Specifically, he asserts that his \u201cinability to use his bedroom due to severe allergies\u201d constituted the \nbreach.  In his complaint, however, he did not allege that he was unable to use the bedroom.  Further, in his opening brief, \nAl-Hamim does not cite any authority indicating that the problems \nhe experienced at the apartment made it \u201cuninhabitable\u201d within the meaning of sections 38-12-503(2)(a)(I) and 38-12-505(1). \n\u00b6 16 \nNor did Al-Hamim allege a plausible claim that the conditions at the apartment materially interfered with his \u201clife, health, or \nsafety.\u201d  \u00a7 38-12-503(2)(a)(II).  We focus on the \u201chealth\u201d prong of the 8 \nstatute because Al-Hamim did not allege that the cat odor or urine \nstains affected his life or safety.  Viewing the allegations in the complaint in the light most favorable to Al-Hamim, see Jagged Peak \nEnergy Inc., \u00b6 25, 523 P.3d at 446, his allegation that the cat urine",
      "smell and stains impacted his health rested on his assertion that he \n\u201cbegan to show signs of an allergic reaction when emptying the [vacuum] canister\u201d on the day he moved in.  He did not allege in his \ncomplaint that the \u201csigns of an allergic reaction\u201d materially impacted his health, that the allergic reaction continued past the \nday he vacuumed the carpet, or that the smell and stains impacted",

Al-Hamim did not allege that he was unable to use any part of the premises due to the carpet\u2019s condition.

(In his response to the landlords\u2019 motion to dismiss and in the opening brief, Al-Hamim argued that the carpet problems \nprevented him from using his bedroom.

In doing so, the Department relies on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e, which allows it to withhold \u201ccritical infrastructure \nsecurity information.\u201d  The Department does not seek to justify its withholdings under any other exemption in its motion, but notes that it \u201creserves the right to review and withhold all exempt \ninformation under other applicable exemptions including, but not limited to, FOIA Exemptions 4, 5, and 6.\u201d  ECF No. 14 at 3 n.2.

Moreover, in any such renewed motion, in the interests of judicial economy, the Department will be required to assert, in \naddition to Exemption 3, any other exemption that it relies on to withhold the records. In FOIA cases in which an agency invokes any FOIA exemption, the \u201cburden is on the \nagency to justify withholding the requested documents, and the FOIA directs district courts to",
      "determine de novo whether non-disclosure was permissible.\u201d  EPIC v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 777 F.3d 518, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  When conducting its de novo review, a court may grant summary judgment based on the agency\u2019s declarations if the \u201caffidavit describes the justifications \nfor withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the \nrecord or by evidence of the agency's bad faith.\u201d  Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011).   That is, the agency must provide a \u201clogical\u201d or \u201cplausible\u201d justi- fication for the exemption, Larson v. Dep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009), and may not rely on \u201cconclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions,\u201d Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108, 1114\u201315 (D.C. Cir. 2007). As the D.C. Circuit explained, agencies must submit sufficiently de-",
      "tailed and specific affidavits for at least three purposes: \u201cit forces the government to analyze \n \n \n3 carefully any material withheld, it enables the trial court to fulfill its duty of ruling on the applica-\nbility of the exemption, and it enables the adversary system to operate by giving the requester as much information as possible, on the basis of which he can present his case to the trial court.\u201d Lykins v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  The withholding agency \u201cmust describe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the \nconsequences of disclosing the sought-after information.\u201d  King v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 830 F.2d 210, 223\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  That information \u201cis necessary to ensure meaningful review of an \nagency\u2019s claim to withhold information subject to a FOIA request.\u201d  Id. at 223. The Department invokes Exemption 3, which applies to information that is exempted from \ndisclosure by statute.  Unlike other FOIA exemptions, Exemption 3 \u201cdepends less on the detailed factual contents of specific documents; the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant \nstatute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statute\u2019s coverage.\u201d   Morley, 508 F.3d at",
      "1126 (citation omitted).  As noted, the Department relies on 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e, which permits the \nwithholding of \u201ccritical infrastructure security information.\u201d  The statute defines that information as:  \nsensitive but unclassified information that, if disclosed, would reveal vulnerabilities \nin Department of Defense critical infrastructure that, if exploited, would likely re- sult in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to Department of \nDefense operations, property, or facilities, including information regarding the se-\ncuring and safeguarding of explosives, hazardous chemicals, or pipelines, related to critical infrastructure or protected systems owned or operated by or on behalf of \nthe Department of Defense, including vulnerability assessments prepared by or on \nbehalf of the Department of Defense, explosives safety information (including stor- age and handling), and other site-specific information on or relating to installation \nsecurity.   \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e(f).",
      "But the Department\u2019s affidavit is not \u201cfurnished with sufficient information\u201d for the Court \nto decide summary judgment \u201cin a meaningful fashion.\u201d  King, 830 F.2d at 223.  It has provided 4\nalmost no specific information about the 5,000 pages it seeks to withhold for the Court to determine \nwhether they are in fact \u201ccritical infrastructure security information\u201d and qualify for Exemption 3 withholding.  Instead, it supplies a few short paragraphs that rely on generalizations and conclusory \nstatements. \nOne specific shortcoming with the Department\u2019s affidavit worth highlighting is that it does not explain to what \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d the withheld records relate.  To qualify as \u201ccritical \ninfrastructure security information,\u201d the information at issue must, \u201cif disclosed . . . reveal vulner- abilities in Department of Defense critical infrastructure.\u201d  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e(f).  The closest the \nDepartment comes is asserting that the information \u201cindividually or in the aggregate, would enable an adversary to identify capabilities and vulnerabilities in the Department\u2019s approach to artificial \nintelligence development and implementation.\u201d  ECF No. 14-1 at 4.  The Court is left to wonder how \u201cthe Department\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence development and implementation\u201d qual-\nifies as \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d under the statute.  Indeed, an \u201capproach\u201d is not usually considered \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d  In addition, revealing \u201ccapabilities\u201d\u2014rather than \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d\u2014does not ap-\npear to move the needle under the statute.  In any event, the Department offers no \u201cspecific infor-",
      "mation\u201d on this point \u201csufficient to place the documents within th[is] exemption category.\u201d  Hay-",
      "den v. Nat\u2019l Sec. Agency/Cent. Sec. Serv., 608 F.2d 1381, 1387 (D.C. Cir. 1979).  All it provides",
      "are \u201cbroad and vague descriptions\u201d of the information that make it impossible for the Court to \nconduct its requisite de novo review over the Department\u2019s decision to withhold this information as \u201ccritical infrastructure security information.\u201d  See Prop. of the People, Inc. v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, 330 F. Supp. 3d 373, 388 (D.D.C. 2018).  \nAside from whether the Department\u2019s \u201capproach to artificial intelligence development and implementation\u201d should be considered \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d the Department\u2019s affidavit is \n \n \n5\ndeficient in showing that its withholdings qualify as \u201ccritical infrastructure security information\u201d in other ways.  For example, the affidavit fails to explain how the disclosure of the withheld infor-\nmation would reveal any alleged \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in the critical infrastructure.  See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e(f) (requiring that the information must, \u201cif disclosed . . . reveal vulnerabilities in Depart-\nment of Defense critical infrastructure.\u201d).1  In many cases, such a connection would be self-evident \u2014for example, the statute provides the case of a \u201cvulnerability assessment\u201d of a military base.  Id.  \nNot so here.  On this point too then, the Court has insufficient information to decide whether the Department has \u201cdemonstrate[d] that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed \nexemption.\u201d Larson, 565 F.3d at 862.2",
      "In short, the overly brief, generalized, and technical (in part) affidavit supplied by the De-\npartment does not enable the Court to fulfill its duty and rule on the applicability of the asserted",
      "FOIA exemption.  See Prop. of the People, Inc., 330 F. Supp. 3d at 377 (finding the agency\u2019s",
      "declarations \u201cinsufficiently detailed and conclusory, and thus, do not permit the Court to determine \n \n1 To be sure, the affidavit describes a long list of the types of information in the Depart- ment\u2019s withholdings.  See ECF No. 14-1 at 4.  But those descriptions do not make up for the defi- ciencies described above.  \u201cTime and again, courts in this Circuit have stressed that the government \ncannot justify its withholdings on the basis of summary statements that merely reiterate legal stand- ards or offer far-ranging category definitions for information.\u201d  Am. Immigr. Council, 950 F. Supp. 2d 221, 235 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Moreover, the \u201cheavy use of technical jargon\u201d in these paragraphs lacks context that would help the Court eval-\nuate whether the information meets the standard under the statute.  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation, 235 F. Supp. 3d 207, 216 (D.D.C. 2017); see also King, 830 F.2d at 221 (explaining that agency affidavits must have \u201cadequate representation of context which, when \ncombined with descriptions of deletions, enables de novo review of the propriety of withholding\u201d).",
      "2 The Court could go on to describe additional deficiencies.  For example, the affidavit \ndoes not sufficiently explain how disclosure of the vulnerabilities at issue, if exploited, \u201cwould",
      "likely result in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to Department of Defense operations, property, or facilities.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 130e(f) (emphasis added).  A \u201c[c]ategorical de-\nscription of redacted material coupled with categorical indication of anticipated consequences of",
      "disclosure is clearly inadequate.\u201d  King, 830 F.2d at 224. \n \n \n6\nwhether the agency may properly withhold\u201d the disputed information).3 Finally, the Court notes that the Department invokes other FOIA exemptions, including \nExemptions 4, 5, and 6, but does not attempt to justify its withholdings under them, instead reserv- ing the right to do so at another other time, presumably through another motion.  See ECF No. 14 \nat 3 n.2.  While the Court appreciates the Department\u2019s desire to avoid the administrative burden of reviewing documents for more exemptions, the piecemeal assertion of different exemptions \n\u201cundermines FOIA\u2019s purpose to promote efficient, prompt, and full disclosure of information and",
      "the interest of judicial economy.\u201d  Woodward v. U.S. Marshals Serv., No. 18-cv-1249 (RC), 2022 WL 17961289, at *8 (D.D.C. Dec. 27, 2022) (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Indeed, district courts retain the discretion to find a defendant\u2019s invocation of FOIA exemptions forfeited if they are not raised timely.  See Shapiro v. Dep\u2019t of Just., No. 13-cv-555 (RDM), 2016 WL 3023980, at *4 (D.D.C. May 25, 2016).  The Court will not exercise its discretion to do so here, given the potentially important national security interests at stake.  Still, the Court advises the \n \n3 The Court also questions whether the Department has sufficiently shown that it conducted",
      "an adequate segregability analysis.  FOIA requires that \u201c[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a \nrecord shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b).  And while the agency is \u201centitled to a presumption that [it] complied with the obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material,\u201d it must still \u201cidentify the \nexempt material and provide descriptions of excerpts deemed to be non-segregable, with explana- tions as to these decisions.\u201d  Greenpeace, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 311 F. Supp. 3d 110, 132 (D.D.C. 2018) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  \u201cThis rule of segregation applies to all FOIA exemptions.\u201d  Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The Department submitted only two sentences in support of its segregability analysis in which it  \nsimply asserts that it \u201cconducted a page-by-page, line-by-line review of each document and deter- mined that no segregation of meaningful information in the withheld documents can be made.\u201d  \nECF No. 14-1 at 6.  Courts have found that such conclusory statements, especially without any-",
      "thing more\u2014for example, a Vaughn index\u2014are insufficient for the Department to meet its obli-",
      "gations.  See Am. Immigr. Council, 950 F. Supp. 2d at 248 (holding that defendant\u2019s \u201cconclusory",
      "assertion\u201d that it \u201creviewed each record line-by-line to identify information exempt from disclo-\nsure . . . will not suffice to discharge this burden\u201d). \n \n \n \n7 Department that when it files its renewed motion, it must address any additional FOIA exemptions it wishes to invoke.  Cf. Shapiro v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 177 F. Supp. 3d 467 (D.D.C. 2016) (permitting the FBI \u201cto assert untimely exemptions to the extent that it can show that the disclosure of such \nrecords will compromise national security or sensitive, personal, private information\u201d (cleaned \nup)).4 For all the above reasons, the Court finds that the Department has failed to provide a suf-\nficient basis to justify it withholdings under FOIA\u2019s Exemption 3.  Thus, it will deny the Depart- ment\u2019s motion without prejudice and permit it to file a renewed motion, which must include all exemptions it seeks to invoke, including Exemption 3.  See Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Just., 185 F. Supp. 2d 54 (D.D.C. 2002); see also Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Just., No. 17-cv-0832 (CKK),",

Plaintiff here has good cause: Plaintiff was sexually assaulted, as a minor, by \ndefendant, which is a matter that is highly personal, private and sensitive. It is a source of humiliation and shame that she did not bring on herself. Plaintiff does not wish to be \npublicly branded as a victim of sexual abuse. 3. Given all this, plaintiff\u2019s interest in protecting her identity outweighs any interest \nthe public may have in knowing it. \n \nWHEREFORE plaintiff respectfully requests the Court permit her to file her lawsuit under a fictitious name.\u201d \nSection 2-401(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) provides: \u201cUpon application and for good cause shown the parties may appear under fictitious names.\u201d 735 ILCS 5/2-401(e) (West \n2022).  \n\u00b6 4",

Plaintiff alleged that defendant sexually harassed and assaulted her while they were both students in high school. \n\u00b6 6 \n \nThe complaint further alleged that, during the 2019-20 school year, six female high-school students reported to the dean\u2019s office that defendant had engaged in sexually abusive conduct \ntoward them; that the high school opened an investigation into \u201ctheir star-student athlete\u201d; that plaintiff did not report defendant at that time, although she did discuss his conduct with close \nfamily and friends; that high school officials called her into their office and took a statement from her; that other classmates (but not plaintiff) publicly exposed the allegations against \ndefendant on social media; that, in July 2022, defendant filed a defamation lawsuit against several classmates (but not plaintiff); and that, since filing suit, defendant threatened to add \nplaintiff to his defamation suit.2 In support of the last allegation, plaintiff attached a letter from",

If plaintiff\u2019s identity was already known to the public, this factor would weigh in defendant\u2019s favor. However, a number of the other federal factors listed by \nDoe would appear to weigh in plaintiff\u2019s favor, including (1) \u201c[w]hether the case involves a highly sensitive and personal matter or requires the disclosure of the utmost intimacy,\u201d \n(2) \u201cwhether denying the motion would increase the likelihood that similarly situated plaintiffs would be chilled from bringing similar claims,\u201d and (3) \u201c[w]hether the movant is a minor, or was a minor at the time of the conduct at issue.\u201d Doe, 542 F.

      "consider, we cannot find it abused its discretion. The place to resolve factual disputes is in the \ntrial court, not a court of review. \n\u00b6 39 Since we lack a sufficient record to evaluate the trial court\u2019s action in denying defendant\u2019s \nmotion, we cannot find an abuse of discretion and must affirm. \n \n\u00b6 40 CONCLUSION \n\u00b6 41 \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to vacate \nthe injunctive order.  \n \n\u00b6 42 Affirmed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10As we already noted above, the record does not indicate, one way or the other, whether plaintiff filed a written response, and the order was issued just 12 days after defendant\u2019s motion was filed.

Nonetheless, the law cannot keep pace with the speed of innovations, compromising privacy. \nCorinne Moini, Protecting Privacy in the Era of Smart Toys: Does Hello Barbie Have a Duty to Report?, 25 Cath. U.J.L. & Tech. 281, 299 (2017) (asserting that privacy torts do not provide \nadequate protection for privacy implications of artificial intelligence and data collection).",
      "When methods of intruding into private lives and stripping anonymity outpace lawmakers\u2019 \nability to address them, courts have a duty under existing rules of procedure to protect sexual \nassault and abuse victims. \n\u00b6 53 Plaintiff, a minor when the alleged sexual assault occurred, undeniably constitutes an \n\u201cexceptional\u201d situation. The lawsuit involves matters of a highly personal nature warranting anonymity. Indeed, Illinois Supreme Court rules acknowledge the need for anonymity in cases \ninvolving minors. For instance, the Illinois Supreme Court rules provide that minors shall be identified by first name and last initial or by initials in adoption cases (Ill. S. Ct. R. 663 (eff. Oct. 1, 2001)) and appeals involving the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/1 et seq. (West 2022)). Ill. S. Ct. R. 660(c) (eff. Oct. 1, 2001). Moreover, the Style Manual for the Supreme and Appellate Courts of Illinois (5th ed. rev. 2017) provides for using the minor\u2019s \ninitials in cases involving the Department of Children and Family Services. These rules reflect the need to protect the identity of a minor in matters of a personal nature that involve potentially \nstigmatizing issues such as termination of parental rights or juvenile criminal conduct. \n\u00b6 54",
      "An alleged victim of sexual violence has similar reasons for protecting their identity when \nfiling a lawsuit under the Gender Violence Act. The alleged conduct involves highly personal conduct likely to embarrass and stigmatize, regardless of its availability on the Internet. Thus, \nI would find that an alleged victim has a compelling reason to proceed anonymously when filing a complaint. Similarly, an accused perpetrator should be able to seek anonymity on \npetition. \n \n\u00b6 55 \n \n \n \n \nWaiver \n\u00b6 56 The appellant contends that Doe waived her right to proceed anonymously because she \nfiled an affidavit supporting a motion to dismiss the defamation lawsuit the appellant filed against his other accusers. (The appellant added Doe as a defendant in the defamation litigation \nafter she filed her complaint.) I must disagree that she waived her right. \n\u00b6 57 When Doe filed the affidavit in the defamation case, she had yet to file her complaint \nagainst defendant. The decision to help another litigant should not bar an individual from \n \n- 12 - proceeding anonymously in their own lawsuit, regardless of an affidavit in another proceeding. \nFiling suit creates a different level of exposure than filing an affidavit in support of others. \n\u00b6 58",
      "Imposing waiver would chill alleged victims of sexual violence from coming forward, \nthereby undermining Illinois policy. For example, the Sexual Assault Incident Procedure Act (725 ILCS 203/15 (West 2020)) requires Illinois law enforcement agencies to develop and \nimplement written policies for responding to sex crimes using evidence-based, trauma- informed, and victim-centered protocols. In addition, laws protect college students who survive \nsexual violence from public disclosure of communications they make in confidence to confidential advisors (735 ILCS 5/8-804(c) (West 2022)) and prohibit hospitals treating sexual \nassault victims from directly billing the victims for the services, communicating with victims about a bill, or referring overdue bills to collection agencies or credit reporting agencies. 410 \nILCS 70/7.5(a)(1)-(4) (West 2022). These recently enacted laws encourage victims to report sexual violence. Yet, should a victim waive anonymity by assisting another alleged victim, the \nintent of these laws would be thwarted. An alleged victim of sexual violence should not have to choose between assisting others in the legal process and their privacy in their case."
